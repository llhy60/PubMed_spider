Sequencing the mosaic genome of Brahman?cattle?identifies historic and recent introgression including?polled.,"Koufariotis L, Hayes BJ, Kelly M, Burns BM, Lyons R, Stothard P, Chamberlain AJ, Moore S.","Brahman cattle have a Bos indicus and Bos taurus mosaic genome, as a result of the process used to create the breed (repeat backcrossing of Bos taurus females to Bos indicus bulls). With the aim of identifying Bos taurus segments in the Brahman genome at sequence level resolution, we sequenced the genomes of 46 influential Brahman bulls. Using 36 million variants identified in the sequences, we searched for regions close to fixation for Bos indicus or Bos taurus segments that were longer than expected by chance (from simulation of the breed formation history of Brahman?cattle). Regions close to fixation for Bos indicus content were enriched for protein synthesis genes, while regions of higher Bos taurus content included genes of the G-protein coupled receptor family (including genes implicated in puberty, such as THRS). The region with the most extreme Bos taurus enrichment was on chromosome 14 surrounding PLAG1. The introgressed Bos taurus allele at PLAG1 increases stature and the high frequency of the allele likely reflects strong selection for the trait. Finally, we provide evidence that the?polled?mutation in Brahmans, a desirable trait under very strong recent selection, is of Celtic origin and is introgressed from Bos taurus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30531891,2018,Sci Rep,4.122,0
Evaluation of 17 microsatellite markers for parentage testing and individual identification of domestic yak (Bos grunniens).,"Pei J, Bao P, Chu M, Liang C, Ding X, Wang H, Wu X, Guo X, Yan P.","BACKGROUND:Yak (Bos grunniens) is the most important domestic animal for people living at high altitudes. Yak ordinarily feed by grazing, and this behavior impacts the accuracy of the pedigree record because it is difficult to control mating in grazing yak. This study aimed to evaluate the pedigree system and individual identification in polled yak.METHODS:A total of 71 microsatellite loci were selected from the literature, mostly from the studies on cattle. A total of 35 microsatellite loci generated excellent PCR results and were evaluated for the parentage testing and individual identification of 236 unrelated polled yaks. A total of 17 of these 35 microsatellite loci had polymorphic information content (PIC) values greater than 0.5, and these loci were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium without linkage disequilibrium.RESULTS:Using multiplex PCR, capillary electrophoresis, and genotyping, very high exclusion probabilities were obtained for the combined core set of 17 loci. The exclusion probability (PE) for one candidate parent when the genotype of the other parent is not known was 0.99718116. PE for one candidate parent when the genotype of the other parent is known was 0.99997381. PE for a known candidate parent pair was 0.99999998. The combined PEI (PE for identity of two unrelated individuals) and PESI (PE for identity of two siblings) were >0.99999999 and 0.99999899, respectively. These findings indicated that the combination of 17 microsatellite markers could be useful for efficient and reliable parentage testing and individual identification in polled yak.DISCUSSION:Many microsatellite loci have been investigated for cattle paternity testing. Nevertheless, these loci cannot be directly applied to yak identification because the two bovid species have different genomic sequences and organization. A total of 17 loci were selected from 71 microsatellite loci based on efficient amplification, unambiguous genotyping, and high PIC values for polled yaks, and were suitable for parentage analysis in polled yak populations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30473935,2018,PeerJ,2.118,0
Genome-wide association study provides insights into genes related with horn development in Nelore beef cattle.,"Stafuzza NB, Silva RMO, Peripolli E, Bezerra LAF, L么bo RB, Magnabosco CU, Di Croce FA, Osterstock JB, Munari DP, Lourenco DAL, Baldi F.","The causal mutation for polledness in Nelore (Bos taurus indicus) breed seems to have appeared first in Brazil in 1957. The expression of the polled trait is known to be ruled by a few groups of alleles in taurine breeds; however, the genetic basis of this trait in indicine cattle is still unclear. The aim of this study was to identify genomic regions associated with the hornless trait in a commercial Nelore population. A total of 107,294 animals had phenotypes recorded and 2,238 were genotyped/imputed for 777k SNP. The weighted single-step approach for genome-wide association study (WssGWAS) was used to estimate the SNP effects and variances accounted for by 1 Mb sliding SNP windows. A centromeric region of chromosome 1 with 3.11 Mb size (BTA1: 878,631-3,987,104 bp) was found to be associated with hornless in the studied population. A total of 28 protein-coding genes are mapped in this region, including the taurine Polled locus and the IFNAR1, IFNAR2, IFNGR2, KRTAP11-1, MIS18A, OLIG1, OLIG2, and SOD1 genes, which expression can be related to the horn formation as described in literature. The functional enrichment analysis by DAVID tool revealed cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, JAK-STAT signaling, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, and osteoclast differentiation pathways as significant (P < 0.05). In addition, a runs of homozygosity (ROH) analysis identified a ROH island in polled animals with 2.47 Mb inside the region identified by WssGWAS. Polledness in Nelore cattle is associated with one region in the genome with 3.1 Mb size in chromosome 1. Several genes are harbored in this region, and they may act together in the determination of the polled/horned phenotype. Fine mapping the locus responsible for polled trait in Nelore breed and the identification of the molecular mechanisms regulating the horn growth deserve further investigation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30161212,2018,PLoS One,2.766,0
The Japanese Wagyu beef industry: current situation and future prospects - A review.,"Gotoh T, Nishimura T, Kuchida K, Mannen H.","In Japan, Wagyu cattle include four Japanese breeds; Black, Brown, Shorthorn, and Polled. Today, the renowned brand name Wagyu includes not only cattle produced in Japan, but also cattle produced in countries such as Australia and the United States. In recent years, the intramuscular fat percentage in beef (longissimus muscle) from Japanese Black cattle has increased to be greater than 30%. The Japanese Black breed is genetically predisposed to producing carcass lipids containing higher concentrations of monounsaturated fatty acids than other breeds. However, there are numerous problems with the management of this breed including high production costs, disposal of untreated excrement, the requirement for imported feed, and food security risks resulting from various viral diseases introduced by imported feed. The feeding system needs to shift to one that is more efficient, and improves management for farmers, food security for consumers, and the health environment for residents of Japan. Currently, we are developing a metabolic programming and an information and communications technology (ICT, or Interne of Things) management system for Wagyu beef production as future systems. If successful, we will produce safe, high-quality Wagyu beef using domestic pasture resources while solving the problems of how to utilize increasing areas of abandoned agricultural land and to make use of the plant-based feed resources in Japan's mountainous areas.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29973029,2018,Asian-Australas J Anim Sci,Not Found,1
Simultaneous introgression of three POLLED mutations into a synthetic breed of Chinese cattle.,"Chen SY, Liu L, Fu M, Zhang GW, Yi J, Lai SJ, Wang W.","The polled phenotype of cattle is increasingly becoming favourable mainly because of the enhanced emphasis on animal welfare, for which the causative mutations have been reported during the past years. The Shuxuan cattle are a new synthetic breed by crossing the indigenous cattle with both Simmental and Holstein semen in Sichuan of Southwest China, in which about 15% of polled individuals have newly emerged. Because official record about POLLED genotypes for the historically imported sires is unavailable, we therefore genotyped the proposed POLLED variants of P202ID, P80kbID and P219ID among 48 polled and 16 horned Shuxuan cattle. It was first revealed that all three candidate mutations have been simultaneously introgressed into Shuxuan cattle, whereas the P202ID mutation is dominant. Furthermore, one polled animal still remains to carry none of the three candidate mutations, which suggests that further mutation(s) would also exist. Additionally, we sequenced mitochondrial DNA and found that Shuxuan cattle are composed of two matrilineal origins of Bos taurus (65.6%) and B. indicus (34.4%); and there is no origin-biased distribution of polled phenotype. In conclusion, our study first supports the recently reported novel candidate mutation of P219ID and detects simultaneous presences of all three known POLLED mutations within a cattle breed.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29053739,2017,PLoS One,2.766,1
Germline mutation within COL2A1 associated with lethal chondrodysplasia in a polled Holstein family.,"Reinartz S, Mohwinkel H, Sürie C, Hellige M, Feige K, Eikelberg D, Beineke A, Metzger J, Distl O.",The bulldog calf syndrome is a lethal form of the inherited congenital chondrodysplasias. Among the progeny of the polled Holstein bull Energy P cases of lethal chondrodysplasia were observed. Pedigrees of the cases and the frequency of 3/8 cases among the offspring of Energy P at our teaching and experimental farm Ruthe (LuFG Ruthe) supported the assumption of a germline mutation with a mosaic of normal and defective sperm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29017490,2017,BMC Genomics,3.73,2
Comparison of milk protein composition and rennet coagulation properties in native Swedish dairy cow breeds and high-yielding Swedish Red cows.,"Poulsen NA, Glantz M, Rosengaard AK, Paulsson M, Larsen LB.","Recent studies have reported a very high frequency of noncoagulating milk in Swedish Red cows. The underlying factors are not fully understood. In this study, we explored rennet-induced coagulation properties and relative protein profiles in milk from native Swedish Mountain and Swedish Red Polled cows and compared them with a subset of noncoagulating (NC) and well-coagulating (WC) milk samples from modern Swedish Red cows. The native breeds displayed a very low prevalence of NC milk and superior milk coagulation properties compared with Swedish Red cows. The predominant variants in both native breeds were 伪S1-casein (伪S1-CN) B, 尾-CN A2 and 尾-lactoglobulin (尾-LG) B. For 魏-CN, the B variant was predominant in the Swedish Mountain cows, whereas the A variant was the most frequent in the Swedish Red Polled. The native breeds displayed similar protein composition, but varied in content of 伪S1-CN with 9 phosphorylated serines (9P) form. Within the Swedish Mountain cows, we observed a strong inverse correlation between the relative concentration of 魏-CN and micelle size and a positive correlation between ionic calcium and gel firmness. For comparison, we investigated a subset of 29 NC and 28 WC milk samples, representing the extremes with regard to coagulation properties based on an initial screening of 395 Swedish Red cows. In Swedish Red, NC milk properties were found to be related to higher frequencies of 尾-CN A2, 魏-CN E and A variants, as well as 尾-LG B, and the predominant composite genotype of 尾- and 魏-CN in the NC group was A2A2/AA. Generally, the A2A2/AA composite genotype was related to lower relative concentrations of 魏-CN isoforms and higher relative concentrations of 伪S1-, 伪S2-, and 尾-CN. Compared with the group of WC milk samples, NC milk contained a higher fraction of 伪S2-CN and 伪-lactalbumin (伪-LA) but a lower fraction of 伪S1-CN 9P. In conclusion, milk from native Swedish breeds has good characteristics for cheese milk, which could be exploited in niche dairy products. In milk from Swedish Mountain cows, levels of ionic calcium seemed to be more important for rennet-induced gel firmness than variation in the relative protein profile. In Swedish Red, lower protein content as well as higher fraction of 伪S2-CN and lower fraction of 伪S1-CN 9P were related to NC milk. Further, a decrease in the frequency of the composite 尾-魏-CN genotype A2A2/AA through selective breeding could have a positive effect on milk coagulation properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28918139,2017,J Dairy Sci,2.749,0
Ichthyosis fetalis in Polled Hereford and Shorthorn calves.,"O'Rourke BA, Kelly J, Spiers ZB, Shearer PL, Porter NS, Parma P, Longeri M.","Inherited forms of ichthyosis, or generalized scaling of the skin, have been reported in many animal species, including cattle, and are characterized by an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. We investigated 2 calves affected with ichthyosis fetalis, a Polled Hereford and a Shorthorn. Both cases had hard white plaques on the skin consistent with excessive keratinization. This was confirmed by histopathology, which showed severe diffuse epidermal and follicular orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis. The known mutation (H1935R) in gene ABCA12, responsible for ichthyosis fetalis in Chianina cattle, was shown to be absent in both affected calves and their obligate heterozygous parents. These molecular findings indicate that allelic heterogeneity exists for this condition in cattle.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28782451,2017,J Vet Diagn Invest,1.219,0
Genomewide association mapping and pathway analysis of meat tenderness in Polled Nellore cattle.,"Castro LM, Rosa GJM, Lopes FB, Regitano LCA, Rosa AJM, Magnabosco CU.","Brazil is one of the world's largest beef exporters, although the product has a low price due to quality issues. The meat exported by Brazil is considered medium and low quality by international buyers, mainly due to lack of tenderness. The predominant Zebu breeds (80% Nellore) are known for producing tougher beef than taurine breeds. Nonetheless, some studies have shown that there is substantial genetic variability for tenderness within the Nellore breed, although it is a difficult trait to improve by conventional selection methods. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a genomewide association study (GWAS) and a gene set enrichment analysis to identify genomic regions and biologically relevant pathways associated with meat tenderness in Polled Nellore cattle. Data consisted of Warner-Bratzler shear force values of LM from 427 Polled Nellore animals divided into 3 experimental slaughters (years 2005, 2008, and 2010). The animals were genotyped with either the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip (777k, on 61 samples) or the GGP Indicus HD chip (77k, on 366 samples). Single nucleotide polymorphisms were excluded when the call rate was <90%, the Hardy-Weinberg proportions -value was <1% (Fisher exact test, Bonferroni adjusted), and the minor allele frequency was <1%. Imputation from the GGP Indicus HD chip to the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip was performed using the FImput program. Genomewide association analysis was performed using the Efficient Mixed Model Association eXpedited (EMMAx) and the population parameters previously determined (P3D) methods. The GWAS was complemented with a gene set enrichment analysis performed using the FatiGO procedure. Significant markers ( < 0.0001) explaining a larger proportion of variation than other significant SNPs were located on chromosomes 3, 13, 17, 20, 21, and 25, indicating QTL associated with meat tenderness throughout the genome. Additionally, gene set analysis identified 22 Gene Ontology functional terms and 2 InterPro entries that showed significant enrichment of genes associated with tenderness. The functional categories included protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase activity, calcium ion binding, lipid metabolic process, and growth factors, among others. These results help to elucidate the genetic architecture and metabolic pathways underlying this trait, which is of extreme economic and social importance to Brazil, because Nellore is the dominant beef cattle breed in the country.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727016,2017,J Anim Sci,1.711,1
Economic considerations of breeding for polled dairy cows versus dehorning in the United States.,"Thompson NM, Widmar NO, Schutz MM, Cole JB, Wolf CA.","This paper examines the costs and benefits of selecting for polled dairy heifers versus traditional dehorning practices. Stochastic budgets were developed to analyze the expected costs (EC) associated with polled dairy genetics. The economic assessment was expanded beyond on-farm cash costs by incorporating cost and benefit estimates to generate industry-wide discussion, and preliminary economic evaluations, surrounding the public acceptance and attitude toward polled genetics versus dehorning calves. Triangular distributions, commonly used to represent distributions with limited data, were used to represent labor costs for dehorning, the likelihood of treatment of calf, and the cost of veterinary treatment. In total, 10,000 iterations were run using @Risk v 6.0 (Palisade Corp., Newfield, NY). The EC of the 4 traditional dehorning methods evaluated in this study ranged from $6 to $25/head, with a mean EC around $12 to $13/head. The EC of incorporating polled genetics into a breeding program ranged from $0 to $26/head depending on the additional cost, or premium, associated with polled relative to horned genetics. Estimated breakeven premiums associated with polled genetics indicate that, on average, producers could spend up to $5.95/head and $11.90/head more for heterozygous and homozygous polled genetics, respectively, compared with conventional horned genetics (or $2.08 and $4.17/straw of semen at an assumed average conception rate of 35%). Given the parameters outlined, sensitivity to individual farm semen and dehorning costs are likely to swamp these differences. Beyond on-farm costs, industry-wide discussion may be warranted surrounding the public's acceptance and attitude toward polled genetics versus dehorning or disbudding of calves. The value of avoiding dehorning may be larger for the industry, and perhaps some individual farms, than initially suggested if additional value is put on calf comfort and possible worker aversion to dehorning. If public perception of dehorning influences market access, the EC of dehorning may be large but that cost is unknown at present.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28342604,2017,J Dairy Sci,2.749,7
Whole-genome analysis of introgressive hybridization and characterization of the bovine legacy of Mongolian yaks.,"Medugorac I, Graf A, Grohs C, Rothammer S, Zagdsuren Y, Gladyr E, Zinovieva N, Barbieri J, Seichter D, Russ I, Eggen A, Hellenthal G, Brem G, Blum H, Krebs S, Capitan A.","The yak is remarkable for its adaptation to high altitude and occupies a central place in the economies of the mountainous regions of Asia. At lower elevations, it is common to hybridize yaks with cattle to combine the yak's hardiness with the productivity of cattle. Hybrid males are sterile, however, preventing the establishment of stable hybrid populations, but not a limited introgression after backcrossing several generations of female hybrids to male yaks. Here we inferred bovine haplotypes in the genomes of 76 Mongolian yaks using high-density SNP genotyping and whole-genome sequencing. These yaks inherited 鈭?.3% of their genome from bovine ancestors after nearly continuous admixture over at least the last 1,500 years. The introgressed regions are enriched in genes involved in nervous system development and function, and particularly in glutamate metabolism and neurotransmission. We also identified a novel mutation associated with a polled (hornless) phenotype originating from Mongolian Turano cattle. Our results suggest that introgressive hybridization contributed to the improvement of yak management and breeding.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28135247,2017,Nat Genet,27.125,18
Increased dietary protein in the second trimester of gestation increases live weight gain and carcass composition in weaner calves to 6 months of age.,"Miguel-Pacheco GG, Curtain LD, Rutland C, Knott L, Norman ST, Phillips NJ, Perry VEA.","Genetically similar nulliparous Polled Hereford heifers from a closed pedigree herd were used to evaluate the effects of dietary protein during the first and second trimester of gestation upon foetal, placental and postnatal growth. Heifers were randomly allocated into two groups at 35 days after artificial insemination (35 days post conception (dpc)) to a single bull and fed high (15.7% CP) or low (5.9% CP) protein in the first trimester (T1). At 90 dpc, half of each nutritional treatment group changed to a high- or low-protein diet for the second trimester until 180 dpc (T2). High protein intake in the second trimester increased birth weight in females (P=0.05), but there was no effect of treatment upon birth weight when taken over both sexes. Biparietal diameter was significantly increased by high protein in the second trimester with the effect being greater in the female (P=0.02), but also significant overall (P=0.05). Placental weight was positively correlated with birth weight, fibroblast volume and relative blood vessel volume (P<0.05). Placental fibroblast density was increased and trophoblast volume decreased in the high-protein first trimester treatment group (P<0.05). There was a trend for placental weight to be increased by high protein in the second trimester (P=0.06). Calves from heifers fed the high-protein treatment in the second trimester weighed significantly more on all occasions preweaning (at 1 month (P=0.0004), 2 months (P=0.006), 3 months (P=0.002), 4 months (P=0.01), 5 months (P=0.03), 6 months (P=0.001)), and grew at a faster rate over the 6-month period. By 6 months of age, the calves from heifers fed high nutrition in the second trimester weighed 33 kg heavier than those fed the low diet in the second trimester. These results suggest that dietary protein in early pregnancy alters the development of the bovine placenta and calf growth to weaning.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27821224,2017,Animal,1.87,2
Low mitochondrial DNA diversity of Japanese Polled and Kuchinoshima feral cattle.,"Mannen H, Yonesaka R, Noda A, Shimogiri T, Oshima I, Katahira K, Kanemaki M, Kunieda T, Inayoshi Y, Mukai F, Sasazaki S.","This study aims to estimate the mitochondrial genetic diversity and structure of Japanese Polled and Kuchinoshima feral cattle, which are maintained in small populations. We determined the mitochondrial DMA (mtDNA) displacement loop (D-loop) sequences for both cattle populations and analyzed these in conjunction with previously published data from Northeast Asian cattle populations. Our findings showed that Japanese native cattle have a predominant, Asian-specific mtDNA haplogroup T4 with high frequencies (0.43-0.81). This excluded Kuchinoshima cattle (32 animals), which had only one mtDNA haplotype belonging to the haplogroup T3. Japanese Polled showed relatively lower mtDNA diversity in the average sequence divergence (0.0020) than other Wagyu breeds (0.0036-0.0047). Japanese Polled have been maintained in a limited area of Yamaguchi, and the population size is now less than 200. Therefore, low mtDNA diversity in the Japanese Polled could be explained by the decreasing population size in the last three decades. We found low mtDNA diversity in both Japanese Polled and Kuchinoshima cattle. The genetic information obtained in this study will be useful for maintaining these populations and for understanding the origin of Japanese native cattle.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27677652,2017,Anim Sci J,1.402,5
"Practices for the disbudding and dehorning of dairy calves by veterinarians and dairy producers in Ontario, Canada.","Winder CB, LeBlanc SJ, Haley DB, Lissemore KD, Godkin MA, Duffield TF.","Disbudding and dehorning dairy calves is very common, despite the introduction of polled genetics to most dairy breeds. Appropriate pain-control practices for these procedures affect both calf welfare and public perception of the dairy industry. Previously published work has shown that North American dairy producers have not widely adopted use of these medications for disbudding or dehorning. However, since the last published work examining these practices in Canada, changes regarding awareness, availability, and future requirements for pain control have occurred in the industry. With this in mind, online and telephone surveys of both veterinarians (n=238) and dairy producers (n=603) in Ontario, Canada, were conducted in the fall of 2014 with a goal of describing current disbudding and dehorning practices and examining factors associated with the adoption of pain control use. Approximately three-quarters of dairy producers reported performing disbudding or dehorning themselves, whereas the remainder used a veterinarian or technician. Almost all (97%) of the veterinarians surveyed reported using local anesthetic, 62% used sedation, and 48% used a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Producer use of local anesthetic was 62%, 38% used sedation and 24% used a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Seventy-eight percent of veterinarian disbudding or dehorning was done before 8wk of age, whereas 64% of dairy producers performed this procedure before 8wk of age. Seventy-two percent of veterinarians and 63% of producers reported changing their disbudding or dehorning practices over the past 10 yr; of producers that changed their practices, 73% cited their herd veterinarian as influential. The use of pain control described in these surveys is higher than previously reported in Ontario. Identification of factors associated with best practices, or the lack of adoption of these practices, may help veterinarians target appropriate educational opportunities for their dairy clients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27665137,2016,J Dairy Sci,2.749,13
Accuracy of genomic breeding values for meat tenderness in Polled Nellore cattle.,"Magnabosco CU, Lopes FB, Fragoso RC, Eifert EC, Valente BD, Rosa GJ, Sainz RD.","Zebu () cattle, mostly of the Nellore breed, comprise more than 80% of the beef cattle in Brazil, given their tolerance of the tropical climate and high resistance to ectoparasites. Despite their advantages for production in tropical environments, zebu cattle tend to produce tougher meat than Bos taurus breeds. Traditional genetic selection to improve meat tenderness is constrained by the difficulty and cost of phenotypic evaluation for meat quality. Therefore, genomic selection may be the best strategy to improve meat quality traits. This study was performed to compare the accuracies of different Bayesian regression models in predicting molecular breeding values for meat tenderness in Polled Nellore cattle. The data set was composed of Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) of longissimus muscle from 205, 141, and 81 animals slaughtered in 2005, 2010, and 2012, respectively, which were selected and mated so as to create extreme segregation for WBSF. The animals were genotyped with either the Illumina BovineHD (HD; 777,000 from 90 samples) chip or the GeneSeek Genomic Profiler (GGP Indicus HD; 77,000 from 337 samples). The quality controls of SNP were Hard-Weinberg Proportion -value 鈮?0.1%, minor allele frequency > 1%, and call rate > 90%. The FImpute program was used for imputation from the GGP Indicus HD chip to the HD chip. The effect of each SNP was estimated using ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Bayes A, Bayes B, and Bayes C蟺 methods. Different numbers of SNP were used, with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100% of the markers preselected based on their significance test (-value from genomewide association studies [GWAS]) or randomly sampled. The prediction accuracy was assessed by the correlation between genomic breeding value and the observed WBSF phenotype, using a leave-one-out cross-validation methodology. The prediction accuracies using all markers were all very similar for all models, ranging from 0.22 (Bayes C蟺) to 0.25 (Bayes B). When preselecting SNP based on GWAS results, the highest correlation (0.27) between WBSF and the genomic breeding value was achieved using the Bayesian LASSO model with 15,030 (3%) markers. Although this study used relatively few animals, the design of the segregating population ensured wide genetic variability for meat tenderness, which was important to achieve acceptable accuracy of genomic prediction. Although all models showed similar levels of prediction accuracy, some small advantages were observed with the Bayes B approach when higher numbers of markers were preselected based on their -values resulting from a GWAS analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27482662,2016,J Anim Sci,1.711,5
Genome-wide Association Study Identifies Loci for the Polled Phenotype in Yak.,"Liang C, Wang L, Wu X, Wang K, Ding X, Wang M, Chu M, Xie X, Qiu Q, Yan P.","The absence of horns, known as the polled phenotype, is an economically important trait in modern yak husbandry, but the genomic structure and genetic basis of this phenotype have yet to be discovered. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study with a panel of 10 horned and 10 polled yaks using whole genome sequencing. We mapped the POLLED locus to a 200-kb interval, which comprises three protein-coding genes. Further characterization of the candidate region showed recent artificial selection signals resulting from the breeding process. We suggest that expressional variations rather than structural variations in protein probably contribute to the polled phenotype. Our results not only represent the first and important step in establishing the genomic structure of the polled region in yak, but also add to our understanding of the polled trait in bovid species.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27389700,2016,PLoS One,2.766,4
Evaluation of breeding strategies for polledness in dairy cattle using a newly developed simulation framework for quantitative and Mendelian traits.,"Scheper C, Wensch-Dorendorf M, Yin T, Dressel H, Swalve H, K?nig S.",Intensified selection of polled individuals has recently gained importance in predominantly horned dairy cattle breeds as an alternative to routine dehorning.

Selection Indices and Multivariate Analysis Show Similar Results in the Evaluation of Growth and Carcass Traits in Beef Cattle.,"Brito Lopes F, da Silva MC, Magnabosco CU, Goncalves Narciso M, Sainz RD.","This research evaluated a multivariate approach as an alternative tool for the purpose of selection regarding expected progeny differences (EPDs). Data were fitted using a multi-trait model and consisted of growth traits (birth weight and weights at 120, 210, 365 and 450 days of age) and carcass traits (longissimus muscle area (LMA), back-fat thickness (BF), and rump fat thickness (RF)), registered over 21 years in extensive breeding systems of Polled Nellore cattle in Brazil. Multivariate analyses were performed using standardized (zero mean and unit variance) EPDs. The k mean method revealed that the best fit of data occurred using three clusters (k = 3) (P < 0.001). Estimates of genetic correlation among growth and carcass traits and the estimates of heritability were moderate to high, suggesting that a correlated response approach is suitable for practical decision making. Estimates of correlation between selection indices and the multivariate index (LD1) were moderate to high, ranging from 0.48 to 0.97. This reveals that both types of indices give similar results and that the multivariate approach is reliable for the purpose of selection. The alternative tool seems very handy when economic weights are not available or in cases where more rapid identification of the best animals is desired. Interestingly, multivariate analysis allowed forecasting information based on the relationships among breeding values (EPDs). Also, it enabled fine discrimination, rapid data summarization after genetic evaluation, and permitted accounting for maternal ability and the genetic direct potential of the animals. In addition, we recommend the use of longissimus muscle area and subcutaneous fat thickness as selection criteria, to allow estimation of breeding values before the first mating season in order to accelerate the response to individual selection.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26789008,2016,PLoS One,2.766,3

Considering genetic characteristics in German Holstein breeding programs.,"Segelke D, T?ubert H, Reinhardt F, Thaller G.","Recently, several research groups have demonstrated that several haplotypes may cause embryonic loss in the homozygous state. Up to now, carriers of genetic disorders were often excluded from mating, resulting in a decrease of genetic gain and a reduced number of sires available for the breeding program. Ongoing research is very likely to identify additional genetic defects causing embryonic loss and calf mortality by genotyping a large proportion of the female cattle population and sequencing key ancestors. Hence, a clear demand is present to develop a method combining selection against recessive defects (e.g., Holstein haplotypes HH1-HH5) with selection for economically beneficial traits (e.g., polled) for mating decisions. Our proposed method is a genetic index that accounts for the allele frequencies in the population and the economic value of the genetic characteristic without excluding carriers from breeding schemes. Fertility phenotypes from routine genetic evaluations were used to determine the economic value per embryo lost. Previous research has shown that embryo loss caused by HH1 and HH2 occurs later than the loss for HH3, HH4, and HH5. Therefore, an economic value of 鈧?97 was used against HH1 and HH2 and 鈧?70 against HH3, HH4, and HH5. For polled, 鈧?7 per polled calf was considered. Minor allele frequencies of the defects ranged between 0.8 and 3.3%. The polled allele has a frequency of 4.1% in the German Holstein population. A genomic breeding program was simulated to study the effect of changing the selection criteria from assortative mating based on breeding values to selecting the females using the genetic index. Selection for a genetic index on the female path is a useful method to control the allele frequencies by reducing undesirable alleles and simultaneously increasing economical beneficial characteristics maintaining most of the genetic gain in production and functional traits. Additionally, we applied the genetic index to real data and found a decrease of the genetic trend for the birth years 1990 to 2006. Since 2010 the genetic index has increased due to a strong increase in the polled frequency. However, further investigation is needed to better understand the biology to determine the correct time of embryo loss and the economic value of fertility disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26601581,2016,J Dairy Sci,2.749,7
A High Percentage of Beef Bull Pictures in Semen Catalogues Have Feet and Lower Legs that Are Not Visible.,"Franks MK, Grandin T.","A total of 1379 beef bull pictures were surveyed to determine visibility of feet and legs from four American semen company websites. Five different breeds were represented: Angus, Red Angus, Hereford (polled and horned), Simmental, and Charolais. In addition to visibility, data on other variables were collected to establish frequencies and correlations. These included breed, color, material that obscured visibility, such as grass, picture taken at livestock show or outside, semen company, photographer, video, and age of bull. A foot and leg visibility score was given to each bull picture. Only 19.4% of the pictures had fully visible feet and legs. Both the hooves and dewclaws were hidden on 32.5% of the pictures. Correlation between bull's birthdate and the first four visibility scores was statistically significant (P < 0.0001). As age increased the feet and legs were more likely to be visible in the bull's picture. This may possibly be due to greater availability of both photo editing software and digital photography. One positive finding was that 6% of the bulls had a video of the bull walking which completely showed his feet and legs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26479372,2015,Animals (Basel),1.654,0
Genetic structure and relationships of 16 Asian and European cattle populations using DigiTag2 assay.,"Yonesaka R, Sasazaki S, Yasue H, Niwata S, Inayoshi Y, Mukai F, Mannen H.","In this study, we genotyped 117 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms using a DigiTag2 assay to assess the genetic diversity, structure and relationships of 16 Eurasian cattle populations, including nine cattle breeds and seven native cattle. Phylogenetic and principal component analyses showed that Bos taurus and Bos indicus populations were clearly distinguished, whereas Japanese Shorthorn and Japanese Polled clustered with European populations. Furthermore, STRUCTURE analysis demonstrated the distinct separation between Bos taurus and Bos indicus (K=2), and between European and Asian populations (K=3). In addition, Japanese Holstein exhibited an admixture pattern with Asian and European cattle (K=3-5). Mongolian (K=13-16) and Japanese Black (K=14-16) populations exhibited admixture patterns with different ancestries. Bos indicus populations exhibited a uniform genetic structure at K=2-11, thereby suggesting that there are close genetic relationships among Bos indicus populations. However, the Bhutan and Bangladesh populations formed a cluster distinct from the other Bos indicus populations at K=12-16. In conclusion, our study could sufficiently explain the genetic construction of Asian cattle populations, including: (i) the close genetic relationships among Bos indicus populations; (ii) the genetic influences of European breeds on Japanese breeds; (iii) the genetic admixture in Japanese Holstein, Mongolian and Japanese Black cattle; and (iv) the genetic subpopulations in Southeast Asia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26260416,2016,Anim Sci J,1.402,13

Novel Features of the Prenatal Horn Bud Development in Cattle (Bos taurus).,"Wiener DJ, Wiedemar N, Welle MM, Dr?gemüller C.","Whereas the genetic background of horn growth in cattle has been studied extensively, little is known about the morphological changes in the developing fetal horn bud. In this study we histologically analyzed the development of horn buds of bovine fetuses between ~70 and ~268 days of pregnancy and compared them with biopsies taken from the frontal skin of the same fetuses. In addition we compared the samples from the wild type (horned) fetuses with samples taken from the horn bud region of age-matched genetically hornless (polled) fetuses. In summary, the horn bud with multiple layers of vacuolated keratinocytes is histologically visible early in fetal life already at around day 70 of gestation and can be easily differentiated from the much thinner epidermis of the frontal skin. However, at the gestation day (gd) 212 the epidermis above the horn bud shows a similar morphology to the epidermis of the frontal skin and the outstanding layers of vacuolated keratinocytes have disappeared. Immature hair follicles are seen in the frontal skin at gd 115 whereas hair follicles below the horn bud are not present until gd 155. Interestingly, thick nerve bundles appear in the dermis below the horn bud at gd 115. These nerve fibers grow in size over time and are prominent shortly before birth. Prominent nerve bundles are not present in the frontal skin of wild type or in polled fetuses at any time, indicating that the horn bud is a very sensitive area. The samples from the horn bud region from polled fetuses are histologically equivalent to samples taken from the frontal skin in horned species. This is the first study that presents unique histological data on bovine prenatal horn bud differentiation at different developmental stages which creates knowledge for a better understanding of recent molecular findings.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25993643,2015,PLoS One,2.766,12

The 80-kb DNA duplication on BTA1 is the only remaining candidate mutation for the polled phenotype of Friesian origin.,"Rothammer S, Capitan A, Mullaart E, Seichter D, Russ I, Medugorac I.","The absence of horns, called polled phenotype, is the favored trait in modern cattle husbandry. To date, polled cattle are obtained primarily by dehorning calves. Dehorning is a practice that raises animal welfare issues, which can be addressed by selecting for genetically hornless cattle. In the past 20聽years, there have been many studies worldwide to identify unique genetic markers in complete association with the polled trait in cattle and recently, two different alleles at the POLLED locus, both resulting in the absence of horns, were reported: (1) the Celtic allele, which is responsible for the polled phenotype in most breeds and for which a single candidate mutation was detected and (2) the Friesian allele, which is responsible for the polled phenotype predominantly in the Holstein-Friesian breed and in a few other breeds, but for which five candidate mutations were identified in a 260-kb haplotype. Further studies based on genome-wide sequencing and high-density SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotyping confirmed the existence of the Celtic and Friesian variants and narrowed down the causal Friesian haplotype to an interval of 145聽kb.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24993890,2014,Genet Sel Evol,3.743,24
The impact of 3 strategies for incorporating polled genetics into a dairy cattle breeding program on the overall herd genetic merit.,"Spurlock DM, Stock ML, Coetzee JF.","Dehorning in cattle has been associated with behavioral, physiological, and neuroendocrine responses indicative of pain. Unaddressed, the pain associated with a routine production procedure could contribute to a negative public perception of livestock production practices. Alternative considerations of dehorning include the selection of polled cattle within herds, thereby avoiding pain and production loss. As polledness results from an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, genetic selection for polled cattle could reduce the prevalence of the horned trait. Herein we discuss 3 strategies to incorporate polled genetics into a cow herd and the estimated impact on the overall genetic merit of the herd. Furthermore, the availability and genetic merit of polled artificial insemination bulls in the United States is summarized. Both Holstein and Jersey dairy bulls registered with the National Association of Animal Breeders from December 2010 through April 2013 were queried. Polled bulls were identified as either being homozygous (PP) or heterozygous (Pp) and the average net merit (NM) predicted transmitting ability (PTA) of each sire group was calculated. The percentage of polled calves born each year over a 10-yr period was calculated for the following 3 scenarios: (A) various percentages of horned cows were randomly mated to Pp bulls, (B) various percentages of horned cows were preferentially mated to Pp bulls, and (C) horned cows were selectively mated to PP bulls, heterozygous cows to Pp bulls, and homozygous polled cows to horned bulls. Additionally, the change in NM PTA of the cow herd was calculated over the same period. The highest percentage of polled animals (87%) was achieved in scenario C. An evaluation of the herd NM PTA highlights the trade-offs associated with increasing polled genetics. Given the current genetic merit of horned and polled bulls, increasing the percentage of polled calves will decrease the NM PTA in Holstein, but may have minimal impact in Jersey herds. Decisions regarding selective breeding to increase polled genetics will need to be evaluated in the context of production objectives, cost of dehorning, and impact on overall genetic merit.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24913645,2014,J Dairy Sci,2.749,15
Independent polled mutations leading to complex gene expression differences in cattle.,"Wiedemar N, Tetens J, Jagannathan V, Menoud A, Neuenschwander S, Bruggmann R, Thaller G, Dr?gemüller C.","The molecular regulation of horn growth in ruminants is still poorly understood. To investigate this process, we collected 1019 hornless (polled) animals from different cattle breeds. High-density SNP genotyping confirmed the presence of two different polled associated haplotypes in Simmental and Holstein cattle co-localized on BTA 1. We refined the critical region of the Simmental polled mutation to 212 kb and identified an overlapping region of 932 kb containing the Holstein polled mutation. Subsequently, whole genome sequencing of polled Simmental and Holstein cows was used to determine polled associated genomic variants. By genotyping larger cohorts of animals with known horn status we found a single perfectly associated insertion/deletion variant in Simmental and other beef cattle confirming the recently published possible Celtic polled mutation. We identified a total of 182 sequence variants as candidate mutations for polledness in Holstein cattle, including an 80 kb genomic duplication and three SNPs reported before. For the first time we showed that hornless cattle with scurs are obligate heterozygous for one of the polled mutations. This is in contrast to published complex inheritance models for the bovine scurs phenotype. Studying differential expression of the annotated genes and loci within the mapped region on BTA 1 revealed a locus (LOC100848215), known in cow and buffalo only, which is higher expressed in fetal tissue of wildtype horn buds compared to tissue of polled fetuses. This implicates that the presence of this long noncoding RNA is a prerequisite for horn bud formation. In addition, both transcripts associated with polledness in goat and sheep (FOXL2 and RXFP2), show an overexpression in horn buds confirming their importance during horn development in cattle.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671182,2014,PLoS One,2.766,37
Genetic analysis of growth traits in Polled Nellore cattle raised on pasture in tropical region using Bayesian approaches.,"Lopes FB, Magnabosco CU, Paulini F, da Silva MC, Miyagi ES, L?bo RB.","Components of (co)variance and genetic parameters were estimated for adjusted weights at ages 120 (W120), 240 (W240), 365 (W365) and 450 (W450) days of Polled Nellore cattle raised on pasture and born between 1987 and 2010. Analyses were performed using an animal model, considering fixed effects: herd-year-season of birth and calf sex as contemporary groups and the age of cow as a covariate. Gibbs Samplers were used to estimate (co)variance components, genetic parameters and additive genetic effects, which accounted for great proportion of total variation in these traits. High direct heritability estimates for the growth traits were revealed and presented mean 0.43, 0.61, 0.72 and 0.67 for W120, W240, W365 and W450, respectively. Maternal heritabilities were 0.07 and 0.08 for W120 and W240, respectively. Direct additive genetic correlations between the weight at 120, 240, 365 and 450 days old were strong and positive. These estimates ranged from 0.68 to 0.98. Direct-maternal genetic correlations were negative for W120 and W240. The estimates ranged from -0.31 to -0.54. Estimates of maternal heritability ranged from 0.056 to 0.092 for W120 and from 0.064 to 0.096 for W240. This study showed that genetic progress is possible for the growth traits we studied, which is a novel and favorable indicator for an upcoming and promising Polled Zebu breed in Tropical regions. Maternal effects influenced the performance of weight at 120 and 240 days old. These effects should be taken into account in genetic analyses of growth traits by fitting them as a genetic or a permanent environmental effect, or even both. In general, due to a medium-high estimate of environmental (co)variance components, management and feeding conditions for Polled Nellore raised at pasture in tropical regions of Brazil needs improvement and growth performance can be enhanced.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24040412,2013,PLoS One,2.766,31
Associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms in candidate genes with the polled trait in Datong domestic yaks.,"Liu WB, Liu J, Liang CN, Guo X, Bao PJ, Chu M, Ding XZ, Wang HB, Zhu XS, Yan P.","The domestic yak (Bos grunniens) is an iconic symbol of animal husbandry at high altitudes. Yaks exhibit unique external characteristics including long hair and large horns. However, hornless yaks can be found in different breeds and different populations. The hornless trait is also known as polled, and the POLL locus has been fine-mapped to chromosome 1 in cattle (Bos taurus), although the underlying genetic basis of the polled trait is still unclear in the yak. Thus, we performed an association study to identify the genetic polymorphisms responsible for the polled trait in the yak. Fifty polled Datong domestic yaks and 51 horned individuals were selected randomly from a huge herd and were used as the case and control groups respectively for the association analysis. Twelve genes located in the candidate region of the POLL locus in cattle were used as references to detect DNA polymorphisms related to yak polledness, which were analyzed by sequencing and a high-resolution melting test. We applied Fisher's exact test and haplotype analysis to show that a 147-kb segment that included three protein-coding genes C1H21orf62, GCFC1 and SYNJ1 was the most likely location of the POLL mutation in domestic yaks.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24033474,2014,Anim Genet,1.841,14

Toward the genetic dehorning of dairy cattle, we introgressed a bovine POLLED allele into horned bull fibroblasts. Single nucleotide alterations or small indels were introduced into 14 additional genes in pig, goat, and cattle fibroblasts using TALEN mRNA and oligonucleotide transfection with efficiencies of 10-50% in populations. Several of the chosen edits mimic naturally occurring performance-enhancing or disease- resistance alleles, including alteration of single base pairs. Up to 70% of the fibroblast colonies propagated without selection harbored the intended edits, of which more than one-half were homozygous. Edited fibroblasts were used to generate pigs with knockout alleles in the DAZL and APC genes to model infertility and colon cancer.

We confirm previous results here and exhaustively identify the causative mutation for the Celtic allele (PC) and four candidate mutations for the Friesian allele (PF). We describe a previously unreported eyelash-and-eyelid phenotype associated with regular polledness, and present unique histological and gene expression data on bovine horn bud differentiation in fetuses affected by three different horn defect syndromes, as well as in wild-type controls. We propose the ectopic expression of a lincRNA in PC/p horn buds as a probable cause of horn bud agenesis. In addition, we provide evidence for an involvement of OLIG2, FOXL2 and RXFP2 in horn bud differentiation, and draw a first link between bovine, ovine and caprine Polled loci.

Efficiency of the spermatogenesis in zebu bulls (Bos taurus indicus).,"Andreussi PA, Costa DS, Faria FJ, Fernandes CA, Guimar?es JD.","The objective of the research was to evaluate the efficiency of the spermatogenesis through the morphology of the testicular parenchyma in bulls of different zebu breeds. We used testicular fragments from bull of the breeds Nelore (n = 10), Polled Nelore (n = 6), Gyr (n = 5), Guzerat (n = 5) and Tabapu茫 (n = 5). The tissue was perfused with Karnovsky solution, included in glycol methacrylate and stained with toluidine blue-sodium borate 1%. Animals of the Nelore breed presented higher population of primary spermatocyte in pre-leptotene/leptotene (38.30) and in pachytene (38.14) and round spermatids (113.30), higher yield of spermatogonia mitosis (21.2) and higher daily spermatic production per gram of testicular parenchyma (32.8 脳 10(6) ) than those from breeds Gyr, Guzerat and Tabapu茫 and higher general yield of spermatogenesis (62.4) than breeds Gyr and Tabapu茫. There was no significant difference in any of the evaluated parameters between breeds Nelore and Polled Nelore. The rate of Sertoli cells did not vary between the studied breeds.

Its clinical spectrum includes polledness (complete agenesis of horns), facial dysmorphism, growth delay, chronic diarrhea, premature ovarian failure, and variable neurological and cardiac anomalies. PMS is also characterized by a deviation of the sex-ratio, suggesting male lethality during pregnancy. Using Mendelian error mapping and whole-genome sequencing, we identified a 3.7 Mb deletion on the paternal bovine chromosome 2 encompassing ARHGAP15, GTDC1 and ZEB2 genes. We then produced control and affected 90-day old fetuses to characterize this syndrome by histological and expression analyses. Compared to wild type individuals, affected animals showed a decreased expression of the three deleted genes. Based on a comparison with human Mowat-Wilson syndrome, we suggest that deletion of ZEB2, is responsible for most of the effects of the mutation. Finally sperm-FISH, embryo genotyping and analysis of reproduction records confirmed somatic mosaicism in the founder bull and male-specific lethality during the first third of gestation. In conclusion, we identified a novel locus involved in bovid horn ontogenesis and suggest that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition plays a critical role in horn bud differentiation. We also provide new insights into the pathogenicity of ZEB2 loss of heterozygosity in bovine and humans and describe the first case of male-specific lethality associated with an autosomal locus in a non-murine mammalian species.

Bovine polledness--an autosomal dominant trait with allelic heterogeneity.,"Medugorac I, Seichter D, Graf A, Russ I, Blum H, G?pel KH, Rothammer S, F?rster M, Krebs S.","The persistent horns are an important trait of speciation for the family Bovidae with complex morphogenesis taking place briefly after birth. The polledness is highly favourable in modern cattle breeding systems but serious animal welfare issues urge for a solution in the production of hornless cattle other than dehorning. Although the dominant inhibition of horn morphogenesis was discovered more than 70 years ago, and the causative mutation was mapped almost 20 years ago, its molecular nature remained unknown. Here, we report allelic heterogeneity of the POLLED locus. First, we mapped the POLLED locus to a 鈭?81-kb interval in a multi-breed case-control design. Targeted re-sequencing of an enlarged candidate interval (547 kb) in 16 sires with known POLLED genotype did not detect a common allele associated with polled status. In eight sires of Alpine and Scottish origin (four polled versus four horned), we identified a single candidate mutation, a complex 202 bp insertion-deletion event that showed perfect association to the polled phenotype in various European cattle breeds, except Holstein-Friesian. The analysis of the same candidate interval in eight Holsteins identified five candidate variants which segregate as a 260 kb haplotype also perfectly associated with the POLLED gene without recombination or interference with the 202 bp insertion-deletion. We further identified bulls which are progeny tested as homozygous polled but bearing both, 202 bp insertion-deletion and Friesian haplotype.

SNP-based association mapping of the polled gene in divergent cattle breeds.,"Seichter D, Russ I, Rothammer S, Eder J, F?rster M, Medugorac I.","Naturally, hornless cattle are called polled. Although the POLL locus could be assigned to a c. 1.36-Mb interval in the centromeric region of BTA1, the underlying genetic basis for the polled trait is still unknown. Here, an association mapping design was set up to refine the candidate region of the polled trait for subsequent high-throughput sequencing. The case group comprised 101 homozygous polled animals from nine divergent cattle breeds, the majority represented by Galloway, Angus, Fleckvieh and Holstein Friesian. Additionally, this group included some polled individuals of Blonde d'Aquitaine, Charolais, Hereford, Jersey and Limousin breeds. The control group comprised horned Belgian Blue, Fleckvieh, Holstein Friesian and Illyrian Bu拧a cattle. A genome-wide scan using 49,163 SNPs was performed, which revealed one shared homozygous haplotype block consisting of nine neighbouring SNPs in all polled animals. This segment defines a 381-kb interval on BTA1 that we consider to be the most likely location of the POLL mutation. Our results further demonstrate that the polled-associated haplotype is also frequent in horned animals included in this study, and thus the haplotype as such cannot be used for population-wide genetic testing.

For the final identification of the causal mutation, we suggest high-throughput sequencing of the entire candidate region, because the identification of functional candidate genes is difficult owing to the lack of a comparable model.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22497248,2012,Anim Genet,1.841,37
Intravaginal progesterone devices in synchronization protocols for artificial insemination in beef heifers.,"Martinez MF, de Nava G, Demmers KJ, Tutt D, Rodriguez Sabarrós M, Smaill B, Corti M, Juengel J.","Two experiments were designed to investigate the administration of intravaginal progesterone in protocols for oestrus and ovulation synchronization in beef heifers. In Experiment 1, cyclic Black Angus heifers (n = 20) received an Ovsynch protocol and were randomly assigned to receive (CIDR-Ovsynch) or not (Ovsynch) a progesterone device between Days 0 and 7. Treatment with a controlled internal drug release (CIDR) device significantly increased the size of the dominant follicle prior to ovulation (12.8 卤 0.4 CIDR-Ovsynch vs 11.4 卤 0.4 Ovsynch) (p < 0.02). Plasma progesterone concentrations throughout the experiment were affected by the interaction between group and day effects (p < 0.004). In Experiment 2, cyclic Polled Hereford heifers (n = 382) were randomly assigned to one of the six treatment groups (3鈥兠椻€? factorial design) to receive a CIDR, a used bovine intravaginal device (DIB), or a medroxiprogesterone acetate (MAP) sponge and GnRH analogues (lecirelin or buserelin). All heifers received oestradiol benzoate plus one of the devices on Day 0 and PGF on Day 7 pm (device withdrawal). Heifers were detected in oestrus 36 h after PGF and inseminated 8-12 h later, while the remainder received GnRH 48鈥僪 after PGF and were inseminated on Day 10 (60 h). The number of heifers detected in oestrus on Day 8 and conception rate to AI on Day 9 were higher (p < 0.01) in the used-DIB than in the CIDR or MAP groups, while the opposite occurred with the pregnancy rate to FTAI on Day 10 (p < 0.01). There was no effect of progesterone source, GnRH analogue or their interaction on overall pregnancy rates (64.9%). Progesterone treatment of heifers during an Ovsynch protocol resulted in a larger pre-ovulatory follicle in beef heifers. Progesterone content of intravaginal devices in synchronization protocols is important for the timing of AI, as the use of low-progesterone devices can shorten the interval to oestrus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21883507,2012,Reprod Domest Anim,1.422,6
Genetic structure of the European Charolais and Limousin cattle metapopulations using pedigree analyses.,"Bouquet A, Venot E, Lalo? D, Forabosco F, Fogh A, Pabiou T, Moore K, Eriksson J?, Renand G, Phocas F.","Pedigree collected by the Interbeef service allowed genetic diversity to be assessed by using pedigree analyses for the European Charolais (CHA) and Limousin (LIM) cattle populations registered in national herdbooks in Denmark (DNK), France (FRA), Ireland (IRL), Sweden (SWE), and, solely for the LIM breed, the United Kingdom (UK). The CHA data set included 2,563,189 calves with weaning performance, of which 96.1% were recorded in FRA, 3.0% in SWE, 0.5% in IRL, and 0.4% in DNK. The LIM data set included 1,652,734 calves with weaning performance, of which 91.9% were recorded in FRA, 4.9% in UK, 1.8% in DNK, 0.9% SWE, and 0.5% in IRL. Pedigree files included 3,191,132 CHA and 2,409,659 LIM animals. Gene flows were rather limited between populations, except from FRA toward other countries. Pedigree completeness was good in all subpopulations for both breeds and allowed the pedigree to be traced back to the French population. A relatively high level of genetic diversity was assessed in each CHA and LIM subpopulation by estimating either effective population sizes (N(e) >244 and N(e) >345 in the CHA and LIM subpopulations, respectively), relationship coefficients within subpopulations (<1.3% in both breeds), or probability of gene origins. However, in each subpopulation, it was shown that founders and also ancestors had unbalanced genetic contributions, leading to a moderate but continuous reduction in genetic diversity. Analyses between populations suggested that all European CHA and LIM populations were differentiated very little. The Swedish CHA population was assessed as genetically more distant from the other CHA populations because of fewer gene flows from other countries and because of the use of North American sires to introgress the polled phenotype. In each European subpopulation, most of the main ancestors, which explained 50% of gene origin, were born in FRA. However, those main ancestors were different between countries. Moreover, in both breeds, the main ancestors, which explained 50% of the gene origin in DNK, IRL, SWE, and UK for the LIM breed, were found to be infrequently used in FRA. Those results were consistent with the low relationship coefficients estimated between subpopulations (<0.6% in both the CHA and LIM breeds). Therefore, in both breeds, each subpopulation may constitute a reservoir of genetic diversity for the other ones.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21606443,2011,J Anim Sci,1.711,19
Transcription profiling provides insights into gene pathways involved in horn and scurs development in cattle.,"Mariasegaram M, Reverter A, Barris W, Lehnert SA, Dalrymple B, Prayaga K.","Two types of horns are evident in cattle - fixed horns attached to the skull and a variation called scurs, which refers to small loosely attached horns. Cattle lacking horns are referred to as polled. Although both the Poll and Scurs loci have been mapped to BTA1 and 19 respectively, the underlying genetic basis of these phenotypes is unknown, and so far, no candidate genes regulating these developmental processes have been described.

Identification of selection signatures in cattle breeds selected for dairy production.,"Stella A, Ajmone-Marsan P, Lazzari B, Boettcher P.","The genomics revolution has spurred the undertaking of HapMap studies of numerous species, allowing for population genomics to increase the understanding of how selection has created genetic differences between subspecies populations. The objectives of this study were to (1) develop an approach to detect signatures of selection in subsets of phenotypically similar breeds of livestock by comparing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity between the subset and a larger population, (2) verify this method in breeds selected for simply inherited traits, and (3) apply this method to the dairy breeds in the International Bovine HapMap (IBHM) study. The data consisted of genotypes for 32,689 SNPs of 497 animals from 19 breeds. For a given subset of breeds, the test statistic was the parametric composite log likelihood (CLL) of the differences in allelic frequencies between the subset and the IBHM for a sliding window of SNPs. The null distribution was obtained by calculating CLL for 50,000 random subsets (per chromosome) of individuals. The validity of this approach was confirmed by obtaining extremely large CLLs at the sites of causative variation for polled (BTA1) and black-coat-color (BTA18) phenotypes. Across the 30 bovine chromosomes, 699 putative selection signatures were detected. The largest CLL was on BTA6 and corresponded to KIT, which is responsible for the piebald phenotype present in four of the five dairy breeds. Potassium channel-related genes were at the site of the largest CLL on three chromosomes (BTA14, -16, and -25) whereas integrins (BTA18 and -19) and serine/arginine rich splicing factors (BTA20 and -23) each had the largest CLL on two chromosomes. On the basis of the results of this study, the application of population genomics to farm animals seems quite promising. Comparisons between breed groups have the potential to identify genomic regions influencing complex traits with no need for complex equipment and the collection of extensive phenotypic records and can contribute to the identification of candidate genes and to the understanding of the biological mechanisms controlling complex traits.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20479146,2010,Genetics,4.075,101
Genetic structure of Eurasian cattle (Bos taurus) based on microsatellites: clarification for their breed classification.,"Li MH, Kantanen J.","We pool three previously published data sets and present population genetic analyses of microsatellite variation in 48 Bos taurus cattle breeds from a wide range of geographical origins in Eurasia, mostly its northern territory. Bayesian model-based clustering reveals six distinct clusters: besides a single-population cluster of the Yakutian Cattle from Far Eastern Siberia and a cluster of breeds characteristic of an early origin, the other four major clusters largely correspond to previously defined morphological subgroups of Red Lowland, Lowland Black-Pied, Longhorned Dairy and North European Polled cattle breeds. The results highlighted past expansion events of the productive breeds such as Danish Red, Angeln, Holstein-Friesian and Ayrshire in northern and Eastern Europe. Based on genetic assignment of the breeds and the availability of breed information, we provide a preliminary classification of the five breeds that were to date undefined. Furthermore, in the analysis of molecular variance, despite some correspondence between geographical proximity and genetic similarity, the breed classification appears to be a better predictor of genetic structure in the cattle populations (the among-group variance component: breed classification, 2.47%, P < 0.001; geographical division, 0.77%, P < 0.001).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19845598,2010,Anim Genet,1.841,33
The scurs inheritance: new insights from the French Charolais breed.,"Capitan A, Grohs C, Gautier M, Eggen A.","Polled animals are valued in cattle industry because the absence of horns has a significant economic impact. However, some cattle are neither polled nor horned but have so-called scurs on their heads, which are corneous growths loosely attached to the skull. A better understanding of the genetic determinism of the scurs phenotype would help to fine map the polled locus. To date, only one study has attempted to map the scurs locus in cattle. Here, we have investigated the inheritance of the scurs phenotype in the French Charolais breed and examined whether the previously proposed localisation of the scurs locus on bovine chromosome 19 could be confirmed or not.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19575823,2009,BMC Genet,2.469,27

A 4 Mb high resolution BAC contig on bovine chromosome 1q12 and comparative analysis with human chromosome 21q22.,"Dr?gemüller C, W?hlke A, Leeb T, Distl O.","The bovine RPCI-42 BAC library was screened to construct a sequence-ready ~4 Mb single contig of 92 BAC clones on BTA 1q12. The contig covers the region between the genes KRTAP8P1 and CLIC6. This genomic segment in cattle is of special interest as it contains the dominant gene responsible for the hornless or polled phenotype in cattle. The construction of the BAC contig was initiated by screening the bovine BAC library with heterologous cDNA probes derived from 12 human genes of the syntenic region on HSA 21q22. Contig building was facilitated by BAC end sequencing and chromosome walking. During the construction of the contig, 165 BAC end sequences and 109 single-copy STS markers were generated. For comparative mapping of 25 HSA 21q22 genes, genomic PCR primers were designed from bovine EST sequences and the gene-associated STSs mapped on the contig. Furthermore, bovine BAC end sequence comparisons against the human genome sequence revealed significant matches to HSA 21q22 and allowed the in silico mapping of two new genes in cattle. In total, 31 orthologues of human genes located on HSA 21q22 were directly mapped within the bovine BAC contig, of which 16 genes have been cloned and mapped for the first time in cattle. In contrast to the existing comparative bovine-human RH maps of this region, these results provide a better alignment and reveal a completely conserved gene order in this 4 Mb segment between cattle, human and mouse. The mapping of known polled linked BTA 1q12 microsatellite markers allowed the integration of the physical contig map with existing linkage maps of this region and also determined the exact order of these markers for the first time. Our physical map and transcript map may be useful for positional cloning of the putative polled gene in cattle.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18629192,2005,Comp Funct Genomics,Not Found,15
Factors affecting the selling price of feeder cattle sold at Arkansas livestock auctions in 2005.,"Barham BL, Troxel TR.","Data were collected from 15 Arkansas livestock auctions to determine factors affecting selling price. Data included how calves were sold (single or groups), sex, breed or breed type, color, muscle thickness, horn status, frame score, fill, body condition, age, health, BW, and price. Data were randomly collected on 52,401 lots consisting of 105,542 calves. Selling prices for steers ($124.20 +/- 0.07), bulls ($117.93 +/- 0.12), and heifers ($112.81 +/- 0.07) were different from each other (P <0.001). Hereford x Charolais feeder calves sold for the highest price ($122.66 +/- 0.14) and Longhorns sold for the lowest price ($74.52 +/- 0.46). Yellow feeder cattle received the highest selling price ($96.47 +/- 0.12), and spotted or striped feeder cattle received the lowest price ($83.84 +/- 0.23). The selling price of singles was lower than the price for calves sold in groups of 6 or more ($117.26 +/- 0.06 vs. $122.61 +/- 0.21; P <0.001).

Cow and calf performance on Coastal or Tifton 85 Bermudagrass pastures with aeschynomene creep-grazing paddocks.,"Corriher VA, Hill GM, Andrae JG, Froetschel MA, Mullinix BG Jr.","Cow and calf performance was determined in a 2-yr, 2 x 2 factorial, grazing experiment using Coastal or Tifton 85 (T85) replicated Bermudagrass pastures (4 pastures each; each pasture 4.86 ha), without or with aeschynomene creep-grazing paddocks (n = 4, 0.202 ha each, planted in May of each year, 13.44 kg/ha). On June 10, 2004, and June 8, 2005, 96 winter-calving beef ""tester"" cows and their calves were grouped by cow breed (9 Angus and 3 Polled Hereford/group), initial cow BW (592.9 +/- 70.1 kg, 2-yr mean), age of dam, calf breed (Angus, Polled Hereford, or Angus x Polled Hereford), calf sex, initial calf age (117 +/- 20.1 d, 2-yr mean), and initial calf BW (161.3 +/- 30.4 kg) and were randomly assigned to pastures. Additional cow-calf pairs and open cows were added as the forage increased during the season. Forage mass was similar for all treatment pastures (P > 0.70; 2-yr mean, 6,939 vs. 6,628 kg/ha, Coastal vs. T85; 6,664 vs. 6,896 kg/ha, no creep grazing vs. creep grazing). Main effect interactions did not occur for performance variables (P > 0.10; 2-yr means), and year affected only the initial and final BW of the calves and cows. The 91-d tester calf ADG was greater for calves grazing T85 than Coastal (0.94 vs. 0.79 kg; P < 0.01), and for calves creep grazing aeschynomene compared with calves without creep grazing (0.90 vs. 0.82 kg; P < 0.03). Calf 205-d adjusted weaning weights were increased for calves grazing T85 compared with Coastal (252.9 vs. 240.3 kg; P < 0.01) and for calves with access to creep grazing (249.9 vs. 243.3 kg; P < 0.05). The IVDMD of esophageal masticate from pastures had a forage x creep grazing interaction (P < 0.05; Coastal, no creep grazing = 57.4%; Coastal, creep grazing = 52.1%; T85, no creep grazing = 59.1%; T85, creep grazing = 60.0%), and IVDMD was greater (P < 0.05) for T85 than for Coastal pastures. Cows were milked in August 2004, and in June and August 2005, with variable milk yields on treatments, but increased milk protein (P < 0.05) for cows grazing T85 compared with Coastal pastures in August each year, contributing to increased calf gains on T85 pastures. These results complement previous research with T85 and indicate increased forage quality and performance of cattle grazing T85 pastures. Calf gains on T85 pastures and for calves on creep-grazed aeschynomene paddocks were high enough to influence the efficiency of cow-calf operations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17526661,2007,J Anim Sci,1.711,20
The effect of veterinary-treated clinical mastitis and pregnancy status on culling in Swedish dairy cows.,"Schneider Mdel P, Strandberg E, Emanuelson U, Grandinson K, Roth A.","The interaction of the effects of pregnancy status and veterinary-treated clinical mastitis on culling in Swedish dairy cattle was analyzed with survival analysis. The data were from 978,780 cows with first calvings between 1988 and 1996. Four breeds (Swedish Red and White (SRB), Swedish Friesian (SLB), Swedish Polled Breed and Jersey) were included in the analysis, together with the SRB x SLB crossbreds. Length of productive life was defined as the number of days between first calving and culling or censoring (end of data collection). The model (Weibull proportional hazard) included the interaction of parity by pregnancy status by veterinary-treated clinical mastitis, peak test-day milk-yield deviation within herd-year-parity, age at first calving, year by season, region, breed, herd production level, and the random effect of herd. The effects of pregnancy status and veterinary-treated clinical mastitis were modeled as time-dependent covariates. The lactation was divided into five stages during which a veterinary-treated clinical mastitis and culling might occur and in which the pregnancy status was assumed to be known and culling could occur. Open cows had a pronounced effect on culling: they had a very high risk of being culled in all lactations, and it was even higher if they were treated for mastitis in early lactation. For pregnant cows, the later they got pregnant during the lactation, the greater their risk to be culled. The risk associated with cases of veterinary-treated clinical mastitis remained important throughout the lactation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17416430,2007,Prev Vet Med,1.924,50

Semiparametric animal models via penalized splines as alternatives to models with contemporary groups.,"Cantet RJ, Birchmeier AN, Canaza Cayo AW, Fioretti C.","Contemporary groups (CG) are used in genetic evaluation to account for systematic environmental effects of management, nutritional level, or any other differentially expressed group effect; however, because the functional form of the distribution of those effects is unknown, CG serve as an approximation to a time-varying mean. Conversely, in semiparametric models, there is no need to assume any functional form for the time-varying effects. In this research, we present a semiparametric animal model (AMS) using the covariate day of birth (DOB) by means of penalized splines (P-splines), as an alternative to fitting CG. In the AMS, the functionality of the data on DOB is expressed by means of a Basic segmented polynomial line (B-spline) basis, and proper covariance matrices are used to reflect the serial correlation among the points of support (or knots) at different times. Three different covariance matrices that reflect either short- or long-range dependences among knots are discussed. Different models were fitted to birth weight data from Polled Hereford calves. Models compared were an animal model with CG, an animal model with CG and the covariate DOB nested within CG (CG + DOB), and P-splines with the first difference penalty matrix and three different AMS with 20, 40, 60, 80, or 120 knots. Models were compared using a modified Akaike information criterion (AICC), which was calculated as a byproduct of the estimation of variance components by REML using the expectation maximization algorithm. All three AMS had smaller (better) values of AICC than the regular model with CG, while producing almost the same ranking of predicted breeding values and similar average predicted error variance. In all AMS, the inference and all measures of comparison were similar when the number of knots was equal > or = 40. The model CG + DOB had analogous performance to the AMS, but at the expense of using more parameters. It is concluded that the use of penalized regression splines using a B-spline basis with proper covariance matrices is a competitive method to the fitting of CG into animal models for genetic evaluation, without having to assume any functional form for the covariate DOB.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16230644,2005,J Anim Sci,1.711,16
Fine mapping of the polled locus to a 1-Mb region on bovine chromosome 1q12.,"Dr?gemüller C, W?hlke A, M?mke S, Distl O.","The absence of horns in Bos taurus is under genetic control of the autosomal dominant polled locus which has been genetically mapped to the centromeric region of cattle Chromosome 1. Recently a 4-Mb BAC contig of this chromosomal region has been constructed. Toward positional cloning of the bovine polled locus, we identified 20 additional microsatellite markers spread over the contig map by random sequencing of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) subclones. A total of 26 markers were genotyped in 30 two-generation half-sib families of six different German cattle breeds segregating for the hornless phenotype including 336 informative meioses for the polled character. Our fine-mapping study involving 19 recombinant haplotypes allowed us to narrow the critical region for the bovine polled locus to a 1-Mb segment with a centromeric boundary at RP42-218J17_MS1 and a telomeric boundary at BM6438.

"Intake, digestion, and N metabolism in steers fed endophyte-free, ergot alkaloid-producing endophyte-infected, or nonergot alkaloid-producing endophyte-infected fescue hay.","Matthews AK, Poore MH, Huntington GB, Green JT.","A digestion and N balance trial was conducted to compare effects of traditional endophyte-infected (E+), endophyte-free (E-), and nontoxic endophyte infected (NE; MaxQ; Pennington Seed, Inc., Madison, GA) Jesup tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) hay on digestion and N retention in steers. Hay composition (DM basis) was as follows: E+ (10.8% CP, 59.9% NDF, and 29.4% ADF), E- (11.8% CP, 58.5% NDF, and 28.4% ADF), and NE (11.6% CP, 58.6% NDF, and 28.3% ADF). Eight Polled Hereford steers (initial BW 240 +/- 9 kg) were used in a replicated, 3 x 3 Latin square design, with an extra steer allotted to each square. Steers were fed ad libitum for 14 d, followed by a 9-d adaptation to restricted intake (based on the animal with the lowest ad libitum intake for the square) and a 5-d fecal and urine collection. Water intake (20.2 L/d) and urine output (7.40 L/d) did not differ (P > 0.10) during the collection period. Plasma prolactin concentration was less (P < 0.05) for steers on the E+ hay (8.83 ng/mL) than for those on the E- hay (18.03 ng/mL) and intermediate for steers on the NE hay (12.65 ng/mL). Endophyte-infected hay differed (P < 0.05) from E- and NE in ad libitum DMI (5.02 vs. 5.62 and 5.61 kg/d, respectively) and ad libitum DMI as a percentage of BW (1.86 vs. 2.06 and 2.06%, respectively). Restricted DMI during the fecal and urine collection was lower (P < 0.05) for E+ hay than for E- (5.04 vs. 5.24 kg/d), and NE was intermediate (5.19 kg/d). Dry matter digestibility was lower (P < 0.05) for E+ compared with E- and NE (62.3 vs. 67.0 and 65.9%, respectively). Digestibility of ADF was lower (P < 0.05) for E+ than for E-, and was intermediate for NE (61.5, 66.0, and 63.9%, respectively). There were no differences for NDF, cellulose, or hemicellulose digestibilities among hay types. Crude protein digestibility was higher (P < 0.05) for E- and NE than for E+ (54.3 and 52.5 vs. 48.1%, respectively). Nitrogen retention was lower (P < 0.01) for E+ than for E- or NE (15.6 vs. 22.7 or 23.0 g/d, respectively). Hay type did not influence plasma urea N, urine urea N output, or urine urea N as a percentage of urinary N. Results from this study indicate that E+ tall fescue hay was lower in ad libitum DMI, DM digestibility, and N retention than NE or E- hays with similar chemical composition. Hay from NE and E- fescue had nearly identical composition, and did not differ for any variable measured.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15827262,2005,J Anim Sci,1.711,34
Effect of aggregation of horn fly populations within cattle herds and consequences for sampling to obtain unbiased estimates of abundance.,"Lysyk TJ, Steelman CD.","Reanalysis of counts of horn fly, Hematobia irritans (L.), obtained from a variety of cattle herds indicated that aggregation of the flies within herds decreased as mean fly density increased. Aggregation was also related to the proportion of fly-resistant and fly-susceptible cattle in a herd. Herds were grouped according to their degree of horn fly aggregation. Low aggregation herds included larger framed Angus, Horned Hereford, Polled Hereford, and Red Poll breeds. Moderate aggregation occurred with Brahman, Charolais, small-framed Angus, mixed cows, and Hereford x Charolais cross. High aggregation occurred with Chianina and mixed herds. Relationships between the sample means and variances varied among aggregation groups. A resampling approach was used to determine the influence of random sampling of a herd on the proportion of horn fly population estimates within fixed percentages of the true mean. The proportion of sample means within +/- 5, 10, 15, and 20% of the true means varied with the proportion of the herd sampled, the mean and variance of fly density, and herd size. Recommendations for obtaining sample size to estimate fly density within a fixed percentage of the true mean are given.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15311450,2004,J Med Entomol,1.968,6
Frequencies of genes for coat colour and horns in Nordic cattle breeds.,"Kantanen J, Olsaker I, Brusgaard K, Eythorsdottir E, Holm LE, Lien S, Danell B, Adalsteinsson S.","Gene frequencies of coat colour and horn types were assessed in 22 Nordic cattle breeds in a project aimed at establishing genetic profiles of the breeds under study. The coat colour loci yielding information on genetic variation were: extension, agouti, spotting, brindle, dun dilution and colour sided. The polled locus was assessed for two alleles. A profound variation between breeds was observed in the frequencies of both colour and horn alleles, with the older breeds generally showing greater variation in observed colour, horn types and segregating alleles than the modern breeds. The correspondence between the present genetic distance matrix and previous molecular marker distance matrices was low (r = 0.08 - 0.12). The branching pattern of a neighbour-joining tree disagreed to some extent with the molecular data structure. The current data indicates that 70% of the total genetic variation could be explained by differences between the breeds, suggesting a much greater breed differentiation than typically found at protein and microsatellite loci. The marked differentiation of the cattle breeds and observed disagreements with the results from the previous molecular data in the topology of the phylogenetic trees are most likely a result of selection on phenotypic characters analysed in this study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14736370,2000,Genet Sel Evol,3.743,20
The scurs locus in cattle maps to bovine chromosome 19.,"Asai M, Berryere TG, Schmutz SM.","Polled, or the absence of horns, is a desirable trait for many cattle breeders. However, the presence of scurs, which are small horn-like structures that are not attached to the skull, can lower the value of an animal. The scurs trait has been reported as sex influenced. Using a genome scan with 162 autosomal microsatellite markers genotyped across three full-sib families, the scurs locus was mapped near BMS2142 on cattle chromosome 19 (LOD = 4.21). To more precisely map scurs, the families from the initial analysis and three additional families were genotyped for 16 microsatellite markers and SNPs in three genes on chromosome 19. In this subsequent analysis, the scurs locus was mapped 4 cM distal of BMS2142 (LOD = 4.46) and 6 cM proximal to IDVGA46 (LOD = 2.56). ALOX12 and MFAP4 were the closest genes proximal and distal, respectively, to the scurs locus. Three microsatellite markers on the X chromosome were genotyped across these six families but were not linked to scurs, further demonstrating that this trait was not sex linked. Because the polled locus has been mapped to the centromeric end of chromosome 1 and scurs has now been mapped to chromosome 19, these two traits are not linked in Bos taurus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14731227,2004,Anim Genet,1.841,28
Risk-adjusted expected return for selection decisions.,"Pruzzo L, Cantet RJ, Fioretti CC.","The results of genetic evaluation are predictions of breeding values for the selection candidates, and these involve uncertainty with regard to future returns from the use of those selected individuals. This uncertainty is due to differential variability in BLUP of breeding values and can be translated into risk: High fluctuations mean greater risk, which is not taken into account by just looking at expected return. In this research, the methodology of value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall is introduced for animal breeding decisions as a means to adjust the expected return for the cost of uncertainty in prediction of breeding values. This methodology has recently received a great deal of attention from financial institutions. Given a specified probability alpha, VaR is the alpha-quantile of the distribution of economic returns. The conditional value at risk (CVaR), or expected shortfall, is the expectation of the economic returns, which are less or equal to the VaR. By subtracting the CVaR from the predicted aggregate genotype (muR), a risk-adjusted expected return (RAER) measure was obtained. The measures muR, VaR, and RAER were calculated for a data set with progeny of 161 Polled Hereford bulls belonging to a beef cattle company. The Pearson and Spearman correlations between muR and RAER were 0.89 (P < 0.001) and 0.90 (P < 0.001), respectively. Even though the latter correlation was high, some bulls ranked differently for muR compared with RAER. The Pearson correlation between muR and VaR was low (0.124) and nonsignificant (P > 0.05), whereas the correlation between VaR and RAER was -0.31 (P < 0.0001). The results indicate the need to take into account the adjustment for risk in expected return in order to alleviate the effects of possible losses when overrated animals are selected.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14677853,2003,J Anim Sci,1.711,15
"Relationship of milk yield and quality to preweaning gain of calves from Angus, Brahman and reciprocal-cross cows on different forage systems.","Brown MA, Brown AH Jr.","Interactions of the regression of preweaning ADG on dam milk yield and quality with breed group and forage environment were evaluated in a two-phase study. Phase I consisted of milk yield and quality and calf gain records from 1989 to 1991 for purebred Angus (n = 64) and Brahman (n = 62) cows mated to sires of both breeds. Phase II consisted of milk yield and quality and calf gain records from 1991 to 1997 for Angus (n = 94), Brahman (n = 85), Angus x Brahman (n = 86) and Brahman x Angus (n = 93) mated to Polled Hereford sires. In Phase I, forage environments included common bermudagrass and endophyte-infected tall fescue. In Phase II, forage environments included common bermudagrass and endophyte-infected tall fescue (1991 to 1995) and a rotational system of both forages (1995 to 1997) in which each forage was grazed during its appropriate growing season, usually June through October for bermudagrass and November through May for tall fescue. Milk yield was estimated monthly six times during lactation from spring through fall and converted to a 24-h basis. Milk fat, milk protein, and somatic cell count were analyzed by a commercial laboratory. In Phase I, the relation of preweaning ADG to milk yield, milk fat yield, and protein yield was greater (P < 0.05) in Brahman cows on bermudagrass than Angus on bermudagrass. The regression of preweaning ADG on milk yield in Phase I was greater (P < 0.05) for cows on tall fescue than cows which grazed bermudagrass. In Phase II, the relation of preweaning ADG to milk yield, milk fat yield, and milk protein yield was greater or tended to be greater (P < 0.01, P < 0.11, P < 0.01, respectively) in purebred cows compared to reciprocal-cross cows. The regression of preweaning ADG on milk yield and milk protein yield was greater (P < 0.05) on tall fescue than bermudagrass in Phase II. These results suggest that the influence of milk yield and quality on calf growth may differ among breed types and production system, and the efficacy of genetic improvements in milk traits may depend on the breed type and forage environment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12413073,2002,J Anim Sci,1.711,42
"Breeding soundness evaluations of 3,648 yearling beef bulls using the 1993 Society for Theriogenology guidelines.","Kennedy SP, Spitzer JC, Hopkins FM, Higdon HL, Bridges WC Jr.","Our objective was to perform a retrospective analysis of breeding soundness evaluations (BSEs) as classified by the 1993 Society for Theriogenology (SFT) guidelines [Chenoweth et al., Guidelines for using the bull breeding soundness evaluation form, in: Theriogenology Handbook, 1993, pp. B-10]. Data included BSE information obtained from five performance-testing stations in South Carolina (SC1, SC2, SC3) and Tennessee (TN1, TN2) from 1986 through 1999 on 3648 Angus, Brangus, Charolais, Chianina, Gelbvieh, Limousin, Polled Hereford, Santa Gertrudis, Simbrah, and Simmental bulls. Analyses were simplified by classifying all bulls as either satisfactory or unsatisfactory potential breeders. Of the 3648 bulls evaluated, 76.2% were classified as satisfactory potential breeders. Of all bulls evaluated, 4.0% were unsatisfactory due to inadequate spermatozoal motility, 7.0% due to inadequate spermatozoal morphology and 2.6% due to a combination of inadequate motility and morphology. Unsatisfactory classifications due to non-spermatozoal parameters out of all bulls were 10.2%, with 7.1% for inadequate scrotal circumference and 3.1% for physical abnormalities. For satisfactory and unsatisfactory bulls, respectively, means and standard deviations were 35.8 +/- 2.7 and 33.0 +/- 4.1 cm (P < 0.001) for scrotal circumference, 63 +/- 18 and 35 +/- 24% (P < 0.001) for percent motility, and 86 +/- 7 and 63 +/- 21% (P < 0.001) for percent normal morphology.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12212894,2002,Theriogenology,2.136,74
Evaluations of genotypexenvironment interactions of beef bulls performance-tested in feedlot or pasture.,"Baker JF, Vann RC, Neville WE Jr.","Purebred Angus (n = 96) and Polled Hereford (n = 96) bull calves sired by bulls of either low or high yearling weight performance lines were assigned to either creep-fed or non-creep-fed treatment before weaning for four calf crops. For each breed, after weaning in the fall, half of the calves within each of the four groups were fed a high concentrate diet for 189 d after weaning in a feedlot and the remainder were put on winter temporary pastures (rye or ryegrass) followed by summer grazing on pearl millet and bermudagrass pastures for 329 d after weaning. Dependent variables were ADG for various intervals and the complete test period, weight, height and scrotal circumference at periodic intervals, and weight per day of age at regular intervals during the test. The model included breed, performance line, sire nested within breed and line, year, age of dam, preweaning treatment, postweaning treatment, and two- and three-factor interactions. Age of calf was included as a covariate for weight, height, and scrotal circumference measurements. Line and breed differences generally were significant for weight but not for height. The interaction of primary interest (line by preweaning treatment by postweaning treatment) was not significant. The high growth performance line gained faster than low growth performance line for all intervals and were 45 kg heavier by 189 d after weaning. Preweaning treatment did not affect postweaning ADG but did affect weight per day of age. Creep-fed calves were heavier than non-creep-fed calves and maintained this advantage during the postweaning treatment periods in both the feedlot and pasture. Both preweaning treatment groups had similar ADG after weaning. Angus were 23 kg heavier at weaning than Polled Herefords; however, breed weight means were similar by 16 mo of age. In summary, bulls from different selection lines for growth were identified in feedlot and pasture when adjustments were made for prior management effects. The lack of significant interactions in these data indicates that central test station data, appropriately adjusted, are useful for ranking bulls on genetic merit for growth in feedlot and on pasture.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12162638,2002,J Anim Sci,1.711,24
Estimates of direct and maternal covariance functions for growth of Australian beef calves from birth to weaning.,Meyer K.,"Records for birth and subsequent, monthly weights until weaning on beef calves of two breeds in a selection experiment were analysed fitting random regression models. Independent variables were orthogonal (Legendre) polynomials of age at weighing in days. Orders of polynomial fit up to 6 were considered. Analyses were carried out fitting sets of random regression coefficients due to animals' direct and maternal, additive genetic and permanent environmental effects, with changes in variances due to temporary environmental effects modelled through a variance function, estimating up to 67 parameters. Results identified similar patterns of variation for both breeds, with maternal effects considerably more important in purebred Polled Herefords than a four-breed synthetic, the so-called Wokalups. Conversely, repeatabilities were higher for the latter. For both breeds, heritabilities decreased after birth, being lowest when maternal effects were most important around 100 days of age. Estimates at birth and weaning were consistent with previous, univariate results.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11712971,2001,Genet Sel Evol,3.743,123
Serum leptin levels in cattle with different nutritional conditions.,"Sansinanea AS, Cerone SI, Zonco I, García C, Auza N.","The role of leptin as an energetic state indicator in cattle was evaluated correlating different nutritional conditions and serum leptin levels. Two experiments were developed. Experiment I: Polled Hereford heifers were fed in optimum conditions and assigned randomly to one of three treatment diets: grazing, grazing plus supplementation and feedlot. Experiment II: cattle were subjected to feed restriction (R). Serum leptin levels were measured at pre and post-feeding moments. Using serum free fatty acid (FFA), beta-OH Butyrate (beta-OHB) and protein concentration as serum energetic indicators in both experiments. In experiment I leptin values were significantly different between pre and post-feeding moments, similar differences were found among groups when the pre-feeding and post-feeding values were compared. These differences may be considered as changes associated to the control of food intake. In experiment II, the serum leptin levels in Group R were significantly lower. The poor energetic status of animals from group R was demonstrated by the serum FFA, beta-OHB and protein concentrations. These results suggest that the energetic status of animals is correlated with the serum leptin levels, tending to maintain the energetic homeostasis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11446988,2001,Nutr Res,2.707,19
Genotype x environment interactions for postweaning performance in crossbred calves grazing winter wheat pasture or dormant native prairie.,"Phillips WA, Brown MA, Brown AH Jr, Coleman SW.","Data from 403 calves from Angus, Brahman, and reciprocal-cross cows sired by Polled Hereford bulls were used to evaluate the impact of postweaning backgrounding forages on postweaning BW, gains, and carcass traits. Calves were born (spring of 1991 through 1994) and reared on either endophyte-infected tall fescue or common bermudagrass pastures. After weaning, calves were transported 360 km to the Grazinglands Research Laboratory, west of El Reno, OK, and, within breed and preweaning forage, were assigned to one of the following winter stocker treatments: 1) winter wheat pasture or 2) dormant native prairie plus supplemental CP. In March, winter stocker treatments were ended and calves were grazed as a single group on cool-season grasses until early July (1992, 1993, and 1994) or late May (1995), when the feedlot phase began. In the feedlot, calves were fed a high concentrate diet for an average of 120 d until a backfat thickness of > 10 mm was reached. Calves were shipped in truck load lots to Amarillo, TX (350 km), for processing and collection of carcass data. Averaged over calf breed group, calves wintered on wheat pasture gained faster (P < 0.01) during the stocker phase (0.71 vs 0.43 kg); had heavier (P < 0.01) final feedlot weights (535 vs 512 kg); lower feedlot (P < 0.01) ADG (1.37 vs 1.53 kg); heavier (P < 0.01) carcass weights (337 vs 315 kg); larger (P < 0.01) longissimus muscle (84.9 vs 81.8 cm2); higher percentage (P < 0.01) of kidney, heart, and pelvic fat (2.32 vs 2.26); and higher (P < 0.01) dressing percentage (62.2 vs 61.3) than calves backgrounded on native prairie. Maternal heterosis for stocker ADG was evident in calves backgrounded on native prairie but not on winter wheat (P < 0.10), but the two environments were similar in maternal heterosis for feedlot ADG and carcass traits. Calves wintered on native prairie were restricted in growth and expressed compensatory gain during the feedlot phase but not during the spring stocker phase. Dormant native grasses can be used to winter stocker calves excess to the winter wheat pasture needs, but ownership of these calves would have to be retained through the feedlot phase to realize any advantage of built-in compensatory gain. Finally, these data suggest that expression of maternal heterosis for weight gain is more likely in calves backgrounded on native prairie than in calves grazed on winter wheat.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11424671,2001,J Anim Sci,1.711,33
"Resistance of Cooperia to ivermectin treatments in grazing cattle of the Humid Pampa, Argentina.","Fiel CA, Saumell CA, Steffan PE, Rodriguez EM.","A field experiment and a controlled efficacy trial were conducted to demonstrate resistance of cattle trichostrongylid nematodes to endectocidal compounds in grazing cattle on the Humid Pampa, Argentina. Male Polled Hereford calves, aged 9-11 months old, with a history of frequent treatments with compounds of the avermectin/milbemycin class, were used for the trial. The field experiment involved six groups of 10 animals each, which were subcutaneously treated with either ivermectin (IVM), long-acting ivermectin (LA-IVM), moxidectin (MXD) or doramectin (DRM) at a dosage of 0.2mg/kg BW. A fifth group was treated orally with fenbendazole at a dosage of 5mg/kg BW; the sixth group of calves served as non-treated control. Faecal samples were collected from each animal on the day of treatment and at 14 days after treatment. Nematode egg counts were performed to estimate the faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT). The FECRT showed that reductions were 65% (IVM), -20% (LA-IVM) and 85% (DRM). Egg counts from calves treated with MXD or fenbendazole were reduced by 95 and 100%, respectively. For the controlled efficacy trial, six animals with the highest egg counts from the IVM, LA-IVM and non-treated control groups, were necropsied on day 18 after treatment to determine numbers and nematode species in the abomasum and small intestine. The results indicated that efficacy against Cooperia oncophora was 62.7 and 48% for IVM and LA-IVM, respectively. Neither of the IVM formulations showed efficacy against Trichostrongylus spp. in the small intestine. However, the absence of Trichostrongylus spp. in some animals of both treated and control groups precluded a valid assessment of efficacy or resistance. It was concluded that resistance of trichostrongylid nematodes to the avermectin/milbemycin class of compounds in grazing cattle of the Humid Pampa, Argentina, may be strongly established on farms where cattle are treated at frequent intervals throughout the year.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11390073,2001,Vet Parasitol,2.422,111
Canadian beef quality audit 1998-99.,"Van Donkersgoed J, Jewison G, Bygrove S, Gillis K, Malchow D, McLeod G.","The second beef quality audit was conducted in Canada in 1998-99 to determine the prevalence of quality defects in slaughtered cattle and to monitor changes since the first audit in 1995. Approximately 0.6% of the number of cattle processed annually in Canada were evaluated. Brands were observed on 49% and tag was observed on 43% of the hides. Both brands and tag had increased from 1995. Seventy percent of the cattle were polled and 5% had full horns; thus, the number of horned cattle had decreased from 1995. Bruises were found on 54% of the carcasses, which was a decrease from 78% in 1995. Sixty-eight percent of the bruises were minor, 28% major, and 4% critical in severity. The distribution of bruises on the carcass was 17% on the chuck, 36% on the rib, 30% on the loin, and 16% on the round. Grubs were observed on 0.008% of the carcasses, and surface injection site lesions were observed on 0.2% of the whole carcasses, a decrease from the 1.3% seen in 1995. Seventy-two percent of the livers were passed for human food and 14% for pet food; 14% were condemned. Approximately 64% of the liver losses were due to abscesses. Five percent of the heads and tongues and 0.3% of the whole carcasses were condemned. The hot carcass weight was highly variable in all cattle, averaging 353 kg (s = 43). The average ribeye area was 90 cm2 (s = 13). Both hot carcass weight and ribeye area had increased from 1995. The average grade fat was 9 mm (s = 5), ranging from 0 mm to 48 mm. Lean meat yield averaged 58.8% (s = 4.6). One percent of the carcasses were devoid of marbling, 17% were Canada A, 49% were Canada AA, 32% were Canada AAA, and 1% were Canada Prime, which was an increase in marbling from 1995. Dark cutters were found in 1% of all carcasses; 1% of steers, 0.5% of heifers, 3% of cows, and 14% of bulls. Three percent of the carcasses were underfinished and 13% were overfinished. The number of overfinished carcasses had increased from 1995. Stages, steers with bullish traits, were infrequently observed in 0.5% of the steers, and 0.2% of the steers and 0.3% of the heifers had poor conformation. Yellow fat was not observed in any steers or heifers, but it was found on 65% of the cow carcasses. Only 0.6% of the heifers had an aged carcass, based on skeletal maturity. Based on August 1998 to July 1999 prices, it was estimated that the Canadian beef industry lost $82.62 per head processed, or $274 million annually, from quality nonconformities, which was an increase from 1995. Additional improvements in management, feeding, handling, genetics, marketing, and grading are needed in the beef industry to reduce quality defects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11272455,2001,Can Vet J,0.558,38
Evaluation of crossbred calf and cow types for the coastal plain of North Carolina.,"Pala A, Robison OW, McCraw RL.","Data in this experiment consisted of 418 lactation records, and weaning and birth weight records from 600 crossbred calves. The traits evaluated included birth weight, weaning weight, weaning weight per cow exposed, weaning weight per weight of cow, weaning weight per weight of cow exposed, and predicted milk yield. Angus, Brangus, and Gelbvieh sires were mated to purebred Hereford cows. Yearling and 2-yr-old Angus-Hereford, Brangus-Hereford, and Gelbvieh-Hereford daughters then were bred to Polled Hereford bulls (Data Set 2). Later-parity Angus-Hereford, Brangus-Hereford, and Gelbvieh-Hereford daughters were mated to Salers or Simmental sires (Data Set 3). Differences between Gelbvieh- and Brangus-sired calves or Gelbvieh-Hereford and Brangus-Hereford daughters were never significant for weaning weight, birth weight, or milk yield. Angus crosses had the lowest weaning weight, birth weight, and milk yield, but the highest kilograms of calf weaned per cow exposed in all data sets. Angus-Hereford and Brangus-Hereford dams had higher weaning weight per weight of cow exposed than Gelbvieh-Hereford dams (P < .01) in Data Set 3.

"Genotype x environment interactions in Angus, Brahman, and reciprocal-cross cows and their calves grazing common bermudagrass, endophyte-infected tall fescue pastures, or both forages.","Brown MA, Brown AH Jr, Jackson WG, Miesner JR.","Reproductive and preweaning data on 190 Angus (A x A), Brahman (B x B), and reciprocal-cross cows (A x B and B x A) and 434 two- and three-breed-cross calves managed on common bermudagrass (BG), endophyte-infected tall fescue (E+), or a combination of both forages (ROT) were used to evaluate the interaction of forage type with individual and maternal heterosis and maternal and grandmaternal breed effects. Cows were born from 1988 to 1991, and calves sired by 13 Polled Hereford bulls were born from 1995 to 1997. Heterosis for calving rate was larger on E+ than on BG or ROT (P < .05), whereas maternal effects were larger on BG than on ROT (P < .10). Maternal heterosis for birth weight was negative on BG (P < .11) but positive on E+ and ROT (P < .10). Grandmaternal effects were evident on BG (P < .10) and E+ (P < .01) but not on ROT. Forage effects were generally substantial for 205-d weight, calf weaning hip height, and calf weaning weight:height ratio; BG was highest, ROT was intermediate, and E+ was lowest. Maternal heterosis for these traits was generally greater on E+ than on BG (P < .10). Grandmaternal effects for 205-d weight, hip height, and weight:height ratio were not important on any forage. Heterosis for weaning weight per cow exposed was substantial on all forages (P < .01) and was significantly greater on E+ (P < .01) than on BG or ROT, but maternal effects were not significant. Thus, we observed more advantage to Brahman-cross cows over purebreds on E+ than on BG. We also observed that moving cows and calves from E+ to BG in the summer will alleviate some, but not all, of the deleterious effects of E+ on calf growth, although it may be more beneficial for reproductive traits in purebred cows.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10764060,2000,J Anim Sci,1.711,32
Physiological responses of Brahman and Hereford steers to an acute ergotamine challenge.,Browning R Jr.,"Research was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of Bos indicus and Bos taurus cattle to a tall fescue ergopeptine alkaloid by assessing vital sign responses. Eight Polled Hereford and seven Red Brahman steers received bolus i.v. injections of ergotamine tartrate and saline vehicle in a simple cross-over design. Physiological traits measured 30 min and immediately before and 30, 60, and 90 min after treatment were respiration rate, rectal temperature, skin temperature at the tailhead and tail tip, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate. Blood samples were collected immediately before and 105 min after treatments to determine plasma prolactin and cortisol concentrations. Steers were fed a fescue-free diet in drylot. Ambient temperature and relative humidity averaged 31 degrees C and 55%, respectively, during data collection. No breed x treatment x time interactions were apparent for vital signs. The treatment x time interaction was significant (P < .05) for blood pressure and skin temperature. Ergotamine increased (P < .01) blood pressure and decreased (P < .01) skin temperature. The breed x treatment x time interactions were significant for prolactin (P < .1) and cortisol (P < .01). Ergotamine decreased plasma (P < .01) prolactin and increased (P < .01) cortisol concentrations in both breeds, despite some breed variation. Across all traits, Brahman and Hereford steers responded similarly to acute ergotamine exposure, indicating that the breeds are alike in acute sensitivity to a systemically administered ergopeptine alkaloid associated with fescue toxicosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10682812,2000,J Anim Sci,1.711,32
"Postweaning performance of calves from Angus, Brahman, and reciprocal-cross cows grazing endophyte-infected tall fescue or common bermudagrass.","Brown MA, Phillips WA, Brown AH Jr, Coleman SW, Jackson WG, Miesner JR.","Data from 403 Polled Hereford-sired calves from Angus, Brahman, and reciprocal-cross cows were used to evaluate the effects of preweaning forage environment on postweaning performance. Calves were spring-born in 1991 to 1994 and managed on either endophyte-infected tall fescue (E+) or common bermudagrass (BG) during the preweaning phase. After weaning, calves were shipped to the Grazinglands Research Laboratory, El Reno, OK and stratified to one of two winter stocker treatments by breed and preweaning forage; stocker treatments were winter wheat pasture (WW) or native range plus supplemental CP (NR). Each stocker treatment was terminated in March, calves grazed cool-season grasses, and calves were then moved to a feedlot phase in June. In the feedlot phase, calves were fed to approximately 10 mm fat over the 12th rib and averaged approximately 115 d on feed. When finished, calves were weighed and shipped to Amarillo, TX for slaughter. Averaged over calf breed group, calves from E+ gained faster during the stocker phase (P<.10), had lighter starting and finished weights on feed (P< .01), lighter carcass weights (P<.01), and smaller longissimus muscle areas (P<.05) than calves from BG. Calves from E+ were similar to calves from BG in feedlot ADG, percentage kidney, heart, and pelvic fat, fat thickness over 12th rib, yield grade, marbling score, and dressing percentage. Maternal heterosis was larger in calves from E+ for starting weight on feed (P<.01), finished weight (P<.10), and carcass weight (P<.16). These data suggest that few carryover effects from tall fescue preweaning environments exist, other than lighter, but acceptable, weights through slaughter. These data further suggest that the tolerance to E+ in calves from reciprocal-cross cows, expressed in weaning weights, moderated postweaning weight differences between E+ and BG compared to similar comparisons in calves from purebred cows.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10064024,1999,J Anim Sci,1.711,22
High-resolution human/goat comparative map of the goat polled/intersex syndrome (PIS): the human homologue is contained in a human YAC from HSA3q23.,"Vaiman D, Schibler L, Oustry-Vaiman A, Pailhoux E, Goldammer T, Stevanovic M, Furet JP, Schwerin M, Cotinot C, Fellous M, Cribiu EP.","The genetic and cytogenetic map around the chromosome 1 region shown to be linked with polledness and intersexuality (PIS) in the domestic goat (Capra hircus) was refined. For this purpose, a goat BAC library was systematically screened with primers from human coding sequences, scraped chromosome 1 DNA, bovine microsatellites from the region, and BAC ends. All the BACs (n = 30) were mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on goat chromosome 1q41-q45. The genetic mapping of 30 new goat polymorphic markers, isolated from these BACs, made it possible to reduce the PIS interval to a region of less than 1 cM on goat chromosome 1q43. The PIS locus is now located between the two genes ATP1B and COP, which both map to 3q23 in humans. Genetic, cytogenetic, and comparative data suggest that the PIS region is now probably circumscribed to an approximately 1-Mb DNA segment for which construction of a BAC contig is in progress. In addition, a human YAC contig encompassing the blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus-inversus region was mapped by FISH to goat chromosome 1q43. This human disease, mapped to HSA 3q23 and affecting the development and maintenance of ovarian function, could be a potential candidate for goat PIS.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10036183,1999,Genomics,2.91,40

"Optimum postweaning test for measurement of growth rate, feed intake, and feed efficiency in British breed cattle.","Archer JA, Arthur PF, Herd RM, Parnell PF, Pitchford WS.","The optimum duration of test for measurement of growth rate, feed intake, feed conversion, and residual feed intake was examined using postweaning feed intake and weight data from 760 Angus, Hereford, Polled Hereford, and Shorthorn heifer and Angus bull progeny from 78 sires. Variance components, heritability, phenotypic and genetic correlations, and the efficiency of selection using shortened tests compared with a 199-d test were used as criteria to assess the optimum test length. The results indicated that a 35-d test was sufficient for measurement of feed intake, whereas a 70-d test was required to measure growth rate, feed conversion, and residual feed intake without compromising the accuracy of measurement. When a 70-d test is used to measure growth rate, feed conversion, and residual feed intake there is minimal loss in accuracy when weights are collected every 2 wk instead of weekly, but a further increase in the interval between weights to 5 wk caused a decline in the accuracy of the test. Therefore a 70-d test with cattle weighed every 2 wk seems to be optimal for measuring these traits in British breed cattle.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9263047,1997,J Anim Sci,1.711,219

"Genotype x environment interactions in Angus, Brahman, and reciprocal cross cows and their calves grazing common bermudagrass and endophyte-infected tall fescue pastures.","Brown MA, Brown AH Jr, Jackson WG, Miesner JR.","Reproductive and preweaning data on 233 Angus (A), Brahman (B), and reciprocal-cross cows (AB, BA) and 455 two- and three-breed cross calves managed on common bermudagrass or endophyte-infected tall fescue were used to evaluate the interaction of forage type with individual and maternal heterosis and maternal and grandmaternal breed effects. Cows were born from 1988 to 1991 and calves from 15 Polled Hereford sires were born from 1991 to 1994. Heterosis for calving rate was similar and important on both forages (P < .01), but maternal effects were small on each forage. Maternal heterosis for birth weight differed between common bermudagrass and tall fescue (P < .10) and grandmaternal effects were evident on bermudagrass (P < .05) but not tall fescue. Forage effects were generally substantial for 205-d weight, weaning hip height, and weaning weight:height ratio (P < .01), and maternal heterosis for these traits was larger on tall fescue than on common bermudagrass (P < .01). Grandmaternal effects were in favor of Angus for 205-d weight, hip height, and weight:height ratio on common bermudagrass (P < .05) but not on tall fescue. Heterosis for 205-d weight per cow exposed was substantial on both forages (P < .01) and was numerically larger on tall fescue than on bermudagrass, but maternal effects were not significant. These results suggest more advantage for Brahman-cross cows over purebreds on endophyte-infected tall fescue than a similar comparison on common bermudagrass. They also suggest an advantage for Angus in grandmaternal effects on bermudagrass but not tall fescue.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9110202,1997,J Anim Sci,1.711,32

"Experimental infection of pregnant cattle with the vaccine candidate Brucella abortus strain RB51: pathologic, bacteriologic, and serologic findings.","Palmer MV, Cheville NF, Jensen AE.","To determine the placental tropism and abortigenicity of the vaccine candidate Brucella abortus strain RB51 (SRB51), a rough mutant of the virulent strain 2308, ten Polled Hereford heifers were inoculated intravenously in the 6th month of gestation. Heifers were euthanatized and examined at postinoculation week (PIW) 8 (n = 5) or at full term (n = 5). Four of five infected heifers sampled at PIW 8 and three of four infected heifers at term had placentitis, whereas reproductive tissues of three normal cows used for comparison had no placentitis. Numerous macrophages, immunoreactive for SRB51 antigen, as well as neutrophils, fibrin, and cell debris filled the arcade zone between chorion and maternal septae. Trophoblastic epithelium of the placentomal arcade zone had intracellular bacteria that were immunoreactive for SRB51 antigen. The tips of maternal septa had a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with small multifocal erosions and ulcerations of maternal epithelium. SRB51 was cultured from all tissues in which lesions were seen. Placentae of one cow from each group had no placentitis and contained no SRB51. In mammae, interstitial lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates and suppurative infiltrates within alveoli and intralobular ductules were seen in two of five heifers at PIW 8. SRB51 was cultured from liver, spleen, lung, and bronchial lymph nodes in four of five calves at PIW 8 and three of four full-term calves, but no lesions were seen. One near-term heifer had disseminated infection, placentitis, and lymphoplasmacytic endometritis, and delivered a premature weak calf. These results establish that SRB51 is less abortifacient than previously published reports with strain 19, in that only one of four heifers delivered prematurely following intravenous inoculation with SRB51, whereas intravenous inoculation with strain 19 leads to 100% abortion. However, it also shows that SRB51 can infect the bovine placenta, mammary gland, and fetus, can induce placentitis, and, in some cases, can lead to preterm expulsion of the fetus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8952027,1996,Vet Pathol,1.795,69
Mapping the Horns (Ho) locus in sheep: a further locus controlling horn development in domestic animals.,"Montgomery GW, Henry HM, Dodds KG, Beattie AE, Wuliji T, Crawford AM.","The presence or absence of horns in Merino sheep is under the genetic control of the autosomal Horns (Ho) locus. Sheep chromosome OOV1 is a candidate region for the Ho locus because it shows conserved synteny with cattle chromosome BBO1 where the cattle polled locus has been located. We demonstrate that the Ho locus in sheep is excluded from sheep chromosome OOV1 and we identified linkage between the Ho locus and markers from sheep chromosome OOV10. These data suggest that there are at least two loci affecting the presence or absence of horns in sheep and cattle. The orthologous regions to OOV10 are likely to be on cattle, human, and mouse chromosomes BBO12, HSA13, and MMU14.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8904835,1996,J Hered,2.574,48

The polled locus maps to BTA1 in a Bos indicus x Bos taurus cross.,"Brenneman RA, Davis SK, Sanders JO, Burns BM, Wheeler TC, Turner JW, Taylor JF.","Two hundred and nine reciprocal backcross and F2 progeny produced by embryo transfer from Angus (Bos taurus) and Brahman (Bos indicus) parents and their 60 parents and grandparents were utilized to localize the locus (POLL) responsible for the polled phenotype in a genetic map of bovine chromosome 1. Progeny were scored for polled, scurred, and horned phenotypes at 1 year of age and again following skull disection at slaughter at 20 months of age. Phenotype frequencies were independent of gender. One hundred and forty-two informative meioses for POLL and 13 microsatellite loci with an average of 267 informative meioses per locus contributed to a genetic map spanning 124.6 cM with an average interval of 9.6 cM. POLL mapped proximal to the centromere and 4.9 cM from TGLA49 supporting a previous study that employed two anonymous microsatellites.

Genetic mapping of the autosomal region involved in XX sex-reversal and horn development in goats.,"Vaiman D, Koutita O, Oustry A, Elsen JM, Manfredi E, Fellous M, Cribiu EP.","Contrary to other genetic disorders, the genetic study of sex determination anomalies in humans stumbles over the difficulty in observing large pedigrees. In goats, abnormalities in sex determination are intimately linked to a dominant Mendelian gene coding for the ""polled"" (hornless) character, which could render this species an interesting animal model for the rare human cases of SRY-negative XX males. In this report, we describe genetic linkage between the polled/intersex synchome (PIS) and four microsatellite markers of the distal region of goat Chromosome 1 (CHI1), quite distinct from the bovine ""polled"" region. According to comparative mapping data, no sex-determining gene has been described so far in homologous regions in the human.

Rostral mandibulectomy for treatment of an ameloblastic fibro-odontoma in a cow.,"Tetens J, Ross MW, Sweeney RW.","A 1-year-old polled Hereford heifer was admitted with a mass of the rostral mandibular area that had been observed 17 days earlier. Cytologic examination of fluid aspirated from the mass revealed normal blood. Radiography revealed an expansile, osteolytic mass involving the rostral portion of the mandible. Mineralization of the soft-tissue component was evident. Rostral mandibulectomy was performed to remove the mass in its entirety. The histologic diagnosis was ameloblastic fibro-odontoma. One year after surgery, cosmetic appearance of the mandible was acceptable, and there was no evidence of tumor regrowth. Radiation therapy, cryotherapy, and thermocautery have been recommended in conjunction with surgical excision to prevent tumor regrowth in the oral cavity.

The effect of amount of body fat and loss of fat on breeding soundness classification of beef bulls.,"Barth AD, Cates WF, Harland RJ.","Two hundred and fifty-one Aberdeen Angus, Horned Hereford, Polled Hereford, and Charolais bulls were examined at the time of sale (sale) and again from 10 to 85 days later (test) to determine the effect of amount of body fat and loss of fat on semen quality. Sale and test measurements included body weight, backfat depth, and scrotal circumference. Breeding soundness evaluations were done at test. For all bulls, over all years, the positive correlations of body weight loss vs. backfat loss, weight loss vs. scrotal circumference loss, and backfat loss vs. scrotal circumference loss were highly significant. Aberdeen Angus, Horned Hereford, Polled Hereford, and Charolais bulls lost weight at a mean rate of 1.77, 2.19, 1.94, 1.16 kg per day, respectively, in the interval from sale to test. Bulls classified as unsatisfactory lost significantly more weight than satisfactory bulls. However, bulls classified as unsatisfactory did not differ significantly from satisfactory bulls in the amount of backfat at sale and test and in the amount of backfat lost. No significant relationship could be demonstrated between increments of backfat and classifications of breeding soundness evaluations. Bulls with satisfactory semen quality had significantly larger scrotal circumference measurements than those with questionable or unsatisfactory classifications. Backfat data at bull sales may be helpful in selecting bulls with desirable growth characteristics, as well as reducing the risk of purchasing bulls with poor semen quality due to excessive body fat.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8748444,1995,Can Vet J,0.558,16
Prediction of genetic values of sires for growth traits of crossbred cattle using a multivariate animal model with heterogeneous variances.,"Nú?ez-Dominguez R, Van Vleck LD, Cundiff LV.","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of adjusting for heterogeneous variances across breed groups on prediction of breeding values (PBV) of selected sires and on breed of sire effects. Data on weights at birth (BWT), 200 d (WW), and 365 d (YW) of purebred and crossbred calves from matings of Angus (A), Hereford (H), Polled Hereford, Charolais, Shorthorn, Simmental, Limousin, Maine-Anjou, Chianina, Gelbvieh, Tarentaise, and Salers Bulls to A and H cows were used. Calf performance in H and A dams was treated as a different trait. Models compared included fixed birth year, cow age, and sex classes and crossbreeding effect as a covariate; random direct and maternal genetic and permanent environmental effects were also included, but their variance structure was different. Model I assumed homogeneous variances across breed groups. Model II accounted for heterogeneous variances. Sires were ranked based on PBV from each model, and means of PBV of selected sires were calculated based on Model II. Differences between mean PBV were small for BWT, intermediate for WW, and larger for YW. Differences in PBV of selected sires increased as selection intensity increased, but only for WW and YW. Large differences in mean PBV of selected sires between maternal environments (H vs A) were observed for WW and YW for various sire breeds. Means of PBV of selected sires based on Model II exceeded those based on Model I by 6 to 16 kg of YW for various selection intensities and maternal environments. Estimates of breed of sire effects from Model I or II were similar for BWT and WW, but large differences were found for YW. Results indicate that some additional economic returns may be gained by commercial producers if sires are chosen across breeds based on predicted genetic values computed with models accounting for heterogeneous variances.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8617664,1995,J Anim Sci,1.711,16
DNA marker-assisted selection of the polled condition in Charolais cattle.,"Schmutz SM, Marquess FL, Berryere TG, Moker JS.","Five Charolais families known to segregate for both horned and polled were selected and tested for linkage analysis by use of microsatellites and karyotyping for Robertsonian translocation 1;29.

Relationship of horn fly to face fly infestation in beef cattle.,"Brown AH Jr, Johnson ZB, Simpson RB, Brown MA, Steelman CD, Rosenkrans CF Jr.","Horn fly and face fly counts (n = 394) taken on 194 beef cows representing seven breed groups were used to determine the effects of horn fly and face fly counts. Breed groups included were Angus (ANI and ANII), Chianina (CA), Charolais (CH), Hereford (HH), Polled Hereford (PH), and Red Poll (RP). The breed group designated ANI consisted of small-framed cows. Total horn fly and total face fly counts were determined weekly on each cow beginning in May and ending in late October or early November in a 3-yr (1988-90) study. Face flies were not counted on the ANI and ANII breed groups in 1988. All fly counts were taken when cows were grazing Ozark upland native grass pastures with only containment fences separating breeding groups. No insecticides were used in the study. Data for analysis were the mean annual horn fly and face fly counts (averaged across weeks), spring weight and fall weights, gain/day between spring and fall weights, and skin surface area in the spring (SSAS) and fall (SSAF) for each cow. Relationships among measurements were examined by correlation and regression procedures. Horn fly count was correlated (P < .05) with face fly count, spring weight, gain/day, and SSAS (.23, .11, -.25, and .12, respectively). Correlations of horn fly count with fall weight and SSAF were non-significant.

Genetic parameters for milk production of Australian beef cows and weaning weight of their calves.,"Meyer K, Carrick MJ, Donnelly BJ.","Estimates of covariance components were obtained for milk production of beef cows, measured by the weigh-suckle-weigh method, and weaning weight and preweaning growth of their calves for a herd of Polled Herefords and a herd of a multibreed synthetics, so-called Wokalups. Analyses were carried out by restricted maximum likelihood fitting an animal model incorporating both direct and maternal genetic and permanent environmental effects and allowing for the direct-maternal covariances. Average 14-h milk yield was 3.6 kg for Herefords and 4.9 kg for Wokalups and heritabilities were .12 and .08, respectively. Treating preweaning gain of the calf as a trait of the cow, estimates of the additive genetic and permanent environmental correlations between preweaning gain and milk yield were higher for Herefords (.73 and 1.00, respectively) than for Wokalups (.53 and .77). Bivariate analyses of milk production (treated as a trait of the cow) and weaning weight (treated as a trait of the calf) showed virtually no direct additive genetic, direct permanent environmental, or phenotypic association between the two traits but identified strong correlations between direct effects for milk yield and maternal effects for weaning weight. The estimate of the direct-maternal genetic correlation between milk yield and weaning weight was .80 for both breeds, and the estimated correlation between direct, permanent environmental effects for milk yield and maternal, permanent environmental effects on weaning weight was unity for Herefords and .89 for Wokalups. Results indicate that milk production is the main determinant of maternal effects on the growth of beef calves with breed differences in the importance of maternal effects largely attributable to differences in milk production.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8056659,1994,J Anim Sci,1.711,111
Differences between progeny of beef sires in susceptibility to fescue toxicosis.,"Gould LS, Hohenboken WD.","Fifteen progeny of two Polled Hereford sires were fed endophyte-infected tall fescue seed (E+) to investigate variability in susceptibility to fescue toxicosis. One sire, bred in Missouri, was reputed to produce calves that were resistant to fescue toxicosis. The Control sire, from Virginia, had unknown merit for susceptibility. There were two phases in which E+ was included in the diet (2 and 4) and three in which it was not (1, 3, and 5). Voluntary feed intake, serum prolactin, cholesterol, and alkaline phosphatase concentrations; ability to maintain homeothermy (afternoon minus morning rectal temperature); and heat-transfer inefficiency (afternoon rectal minus afternoon surface temperatures) were monitored. Intake and prolactin concentration were decreased by E+, but sire groups did not differ in responses across phases. Cholesterol levels were lower during E+ phases, and the rate of increase in cholesterol concentration after withdrawal of E+ differed between groups. Alkaline phosphatase concentrations were lower during E+ phases; calves from the Control sire showed greater reduction than calves sired by the Missouri sire. Ability to maintain homeothermy was reduced by E+, but the reduction did not differ between sire groups. Heat-transfer inefficiences were not indicative of fescue toxicosis in this study. Evidence was not compelling to support the existence of differences between the sire groups for susceptibility to toxicosis. However, progeny of the Missouri bull had higher feed intake and lower rectal and body surface temperatures through nearly all phases of the trial. This may account for the reputation of the Missouri bull to sire calves with relatively high resistance to fescue toxicosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8270524,1993,J Anim Sci,1.711,20
Immune responses and protection against infection and abortion in cattle experimentally vaccinated with mutant strains of Brucella abortus.,"Cheville NF, Stevens MG, Jensen AE, Tatum FM, Halling SM.","Twenty-four 10-month-old Polled Hereford heifers were inoculated SC with live cells of one of the following strains of Brucella abortus: S19 delta 31K (n = 4), S19 delta SOD (n = 4), RB51 (n = 4), and strain 19 (n = 6); controls (n = 6) were given saline solution. Heifers given the deletion mutants S19 delta 31K and S19 delta SOD, and those given strain 19 developed antibody responses to B abortus and cutaneous reactions to brucellin. Heifers given strain RB51 did not develop antibodies that reacted in the standard tube agglutination test, but sera reacted in tests, using an antibody dot-blot assay containing RB51 antigen. The S19 delta 31K and S19 delta SOD strains of B abortus isolated from lymph node tissue after vaccination did not differ genetically from the master stock strain. All heifers were bred naturally at 16 to 17 months of age, and were challenge-exposed intraconjunctivally with virulent B abortus strain 2308 during the fifth month of pregnancy. All vaccinated heifers were protected (ie, none aborted and none had B abortus isolated from their tissues after parturition). Calves born from vaccinated dams were free of B abortus. Antibody responses in heifers after challenge exposure were an indicator of immunity. All 5 control heifers (nonvaccinated) developed serum antibodies after challenge exposure; 3 aborted, and 1 delivered a small, weak calf at 8.5 months of gestation. Thus live mutant strains of B abortus can induce protective immunity when given at 10 months of age, and strain RB51 is a strong candidate for further testing.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8250382,1993,Am J Vet Res,0.833,188

Data originated from an experiment in Western Australia selecting for preweaning growth rate. Analyses were carried out by REML fitting an animal model including genetic and permanent environmental maternal effects. Wokalups showed consistently more phenotypic variation, partly due to a scale effect, and higher direct and lower maternal heritabilities than Herefords. Maternal environmental effects were more than twice as important in Herefords than in Wokalups.

Correlations for genetic expression for growth of calves of Hereford and Angus dams using a multivariate animal model.,"Nú?ez-Dominguez R, Van Vleck LD, Boldman KG, Cundiff LV.","The purpose of this study was to estimate the correlation between the expression of genes from sires in purebred and crossbred progeny (rPC) and in Hereford and Angus F1 calves (rHA). Performance traits were weights at birth, 200 d, and 365 d. Progeny from Hereford, Polled Hereford, and Angus bulls mated to Hereford or Angus cows were used to estimate rPC. Progeny from Charolais, Shorthorn, Simmental, Limousin, Maine-Anjou, Chianina, Gelbvieh, Tarentaise, and Salers bulls mated to Hereford or Angus cows were used to estimate rHA. Performances in purebreds (P) and crosses (C) or in Hereford (H) and Angus (A) F1 calves were treated as separate traits. A multivariate animal model with birth year-cow age-sex subclasses, random correlated direct and maternal additive genetic effects, and maternal permanent environmental effects was used. Separate analyses were done by breed of sire. A derivative-free algorithm was used to obtain REML estimates of (co)variance components. Weighted averages across breeds of estimates of heritability for P, C, H, and A were, respectively, .61, .51, .47, and .40 for birth weight, .41, .46, .37, and .34 for weaning weight, and .50, .49, .42, and .46 for yearling weight.

Pregnancy-specific protein B in serum of postpartum beef cows.,"Kiracofe GH, Wright JM, Schalles RR, Ruder CA, Parish S, Sasser RG.","To determine whether the uterus was the source of serum pregnancy-specific protein B (PSPB) after calving, five beef cows were hysterectomized at 21 d postpartum and five served as intact controls. A single blood sample was taken from all cows immediately after calving and then twice weekly until 21 d postpartum. Beginning on d 22, blood samples were taken from all cows at 3-h intervals for 4 d and then twice weekly until 53 d postpartum. When the half-life calculated for the interval from d 1 to 21 was used as a covariate, the adjusted d-22 to -53 half-lives were 8.4 d for control cows vs 7.3 d for hysterectomized cows (P = .044). Data show that PSPB has a long half-life in the circulation and that the uterus is a minimal, if any, source of postpartum circulating PSPB. In another experiment, PSPB was measured weekly after calving in serum of 58 Polled Hereford and Simmental cows. Cows were exposed to fertile bulls and allowed to mate at every estrus. Observations were made for estrus, and progesterone concentrations in serum were measured to estimate the time of ovulations. Levels of PSPB were highest at approximately the time of calving, then decreased rapidly. Concentrations of PSPB were < 1 ng/mL by 80 d in eight cows that had not conceived since calving. Two cows eventually had nondetectable PSPB levels, one by 86 d and the other by 96 d after calving.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8376246,1993,J Anim Sci,1.711,76
Genetic and environmental parameters for mature weight and other growth measures in Polled Hereford cattle.,"Bullock KD, Bertrand JK, Benyshek LL.","Variances and covariances were estimated for birth weight (BWT), weaning weight (WW), yearling gain (YG), yearling weight (YW), yearling height (YH), relative growth from birth to weaning (RGW) and weaning to yearling (RGY), and mature weight (MW). Field records on 572,446 Polled Hereford cattle were analyzed. Because multiple dam weights were collected on a cow the MW used in the analysis was calculated using a nonlinear regression correction factor computed by fitting a quadratic with a plateau to the data. If the cow had an observation(s) beyond the inflection point (IP), the closest weight to that point was used. If the cow only had observation(s) before the IP the closest weight to that point was nonlinearly adjusted to the plateau. The IP for this data set was 1,506 d and the plateau was 554.7 kg.

"Epidemiologic findings in congenital anemia, dyserythropoiesis, and dyskeratosis in polled Hereford calves.","Steffen DJ, Leipold HW, Schalles R, Kemp K, Smith JE.","Congenital dyserythropoiesis and dyskeratosis occur within certain lines of Polled Hereford cattle. Eighty-nine of 90 alleles in 45 affected calves had a mechanism in which they could be identical by descent from an identified common ancestor. The line allele may have been a recurrence of the mutation, or the mutation may have occurred earlier in the breed's history and been distributed throughout the breed by the extensive use of several ancestors. No evidence of disease has been identified in sire and dams of affected calves, suggesting that the allele is not acting in a dominant or incompletely dominant manner. Even distribution of cases between sexes suggests that the disease is not sex linked or sex influenced. A higher degree of inbreeding in the affected calves and temporal and spatial features that separated individual cases also suggest a genetic cause. Segregation ratios were not significantly different from those of the hypothesized simple autosomal recessive inheritance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8340614,1993,J Hered,2.574,9

The effect of United States versus New Zealand Angus germplasm on characteristics of crossbred calves.,"Hohenboken WD, McClure WH.","Blood selenium concentration at birth and growth from birth through finishing were analyzed on progeny from two birth years of Angus bulls of United States (US) or New Zealand (NZ) origin. Dams of the calves were Polled Hereford x Angus crossbreds whose sires had been selected divergently from the national sire summary to be superior (+) or inferior (-) for yearling weight EPD (G) and for total maternal effects (M) on weaning weight. There was no evidence of differences attributable to calf paternity or dam genetic group in concentration of blood selenium in calves at birth. For birth year 1988, progeny of US sires grew nonsignificantly more rapidly than progeny of NZ sires in most life-cycle phases. In 1989 calves, NZ-sired offspring grew nonsignificantly more rapidly than US-sired offspring through a year of age. Averaged across years, preweaning and postweaning growth rates were similar for calves of US and NZ paternity. Divergent selection of the calves' maternal grandsires for yearling weight EPD was successful; calves in +G groups had more rapid gains through 1 yr of age than did calves in -G groups. Also, growth rate through 4.5 mo of age was influenced by divergent selection of maternal grandsires on total maternal weaning weight EPD; calves from +M groups gained more rapidly than calves from -M groups.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8325799,1993,J Anim Sci,1.711,2
Live animal measurement of carcass traits: estimation of genetic parameters for beef cattle.,"Robinson DL, Hammond K, McDonald CA.","Ultrasound measurements by trained and accredited sonographers on 9,232 Angus, Hereford, and Polled Hereford cattle at an average age of 450 d were used to estimate genetic and environmental (co)variances for weight at scanning (Wt), longissimus muscle area (LMA), longissimus muscle area adjusted to a constant weight of 400 kg (LMAawt), and fat depths at the rump and 12/13 rib sites. Estimated kilograms (ESMkg) and percentage of saleable meat yield (ESM%) were also calculated and analyzed. Subjective muscle scores, available for 2,488 animals, were also included in the analysis. Estimated heritabilities were 46% for Wt, 21% for LMA and LMAawt, 37% for rump fat, 30% for rib fat, 15% for muscle score, 44% for ESMkg, and 36% for ESM%. The two measurements, LMA and LMAawt, had high genetic (.82) and environmental (.91) correlations. The two fat depths were also highly correlated (.86 genetic; .67 environmental). Weight at scanning was moderately correlated with LMA (.45 genetic; .41 environmental). Differences between breeds could not be detected, but some variation in parameter estimates between data sets of the same breed was observed. Environmental correlations between fat depths or muscle score and Wt were approximately .3; genetic correlations were .07 to .12. Subjective muscle score had marginally higher genetic correlations with LMA than with LMAawt (.22 vs .08) but similar environmental correlations (.31 vs .27). Results show that carcass traits measured by ultrasound and predictions of meat yield have genetic variability, are moderately heritable, and that genetic progress based on genetic evaluation by mixed-model analysis can be made.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8505244,1993,J Anim Sci,1.711,69
Individual variation within breeds of beef cattle in resistance to horn fly (Diptera: Muscidae).,"Steelman CD, Gbur EE, Tolley G, Brown AH Jr.","Weekly estimates of populations of horn fly, Haematobia irritans (L.), were made on individual purebred Charolais, Chianina, Hereford, Polled Hereford, and Red Poll cows in 1988, 1989, and 1990 with Angus included in 1989 and 1990. During the study period, 94 of approximately 200 individual cows were classified as either fly resistant or fly susceptible. In general, individuals retained the same classification over the 3-yr study period. The mean number of flies on individual susceptible cows in all breeds was at least twice the number of flies on resistant cows. Susceptible Chianina cows averaged > 4.5 times as many flies as resistant cows of the same breed. Individual cows within all breeds classified as fly resistant ranged in age from 2 to 12 yr, whereas fly-susceptible cows ranged in age from 2 to 14 yr; therefore, cow age did not influence the abundance of horn flies on individual cows within breeds. Two-year-old fly-resistant cows were identified accurately according to their horn fly-population density, showing the potential of host resistance in horn fly-population management.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8459419,1993,J Med Entomol,1.968,36
Relationship of maternal milk expected progeny differences to actual milk yield and calf weaning weight.,"Mallinckrodt CH, Bourdon RM, Golden BL, Schalles RR, Odde KG.",Calf weaning weights and estimates of 205-d milk yield (n = 317) were obtained from 90 Polled Hereford (PH) and 80 Simmental (SM) cows to evaluate the relationship of these measures with maternal milk and total maternal EPD from national cattle evaluations. An inverse parabolic exponential function predicted 205-d milk yields for each cow from five estimates of daily milk yield taken once per month via calf weigh-suckle-weigh. Changes in calves' 205-d adjusted weights were greater than predicted (P < .02) by maternal milk EPD of PH and SM dams and PH maternal grandsires (MGS) but were similar to changes predicted by SM MGS (P > .50). These changes were also greater than those predicted by total maternal EPD of PH dams and MGS (P < .02) but were similar to those predicted in SM dams and MGS (P > .38). Interactions of maternal milk and total maternal EPD with sex of calf and year did not influence calves' 205-d adjusted weights (P > .10). A positive relationship was found in both breeds between 205-d milk yield EPD (calculated from 205-d milk yield estimates) and maternal milk EPD from national cattle evaluations. Objectively assessing the magnitude of this relationship was hindered by problems in estimating heritability and interpreting correlations between EPD. These data indicate that maternal milk and total maternal EPD from national cattle evaluations are reasonably good predictors of genetic differences in milk yield and weaning weight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8440654,1993,J Anim Sci,1.711,53
"Comparison of whole, raw soybeans, extruded soybeans, or soybean meal and barley on digestive characteristics and performance of weaned beef steers consuming mature grass hay.","Albro JD, Weber DW, DelCurto T.","Two experiments were conducted to compare whole, raw soybeans (WSB), extruded soybeans (ESB), and soybean meal+barley (SBM+BAR) as supplemental protein sources for growing beef steers consuming low-quality, mature grass hay (6.5% CP). In Exp. 1, a 23-d digestion study, four ruminally cannulated steers were assigned to the following treatments in a 4 x 4 Latin square design: 1) control, no supplement; 2) 1.5 kg.animal-1.d-1 of WSB; 3) 1.36 kg.animal-1.d-1 of ESB; and 4) 1.48 kg.animal-1.d-1 of 62%:38% SBM+BAR. Apparent DM digestibility was increased by supplementation (P < .10), but NDF digestibility was not changed (P > .10). No differences in digestibility were observed among supplement treatments (P > .10). In situ rate and extent of supplement CP disappearance in Dacron bags did not differ among supplements (P > .10), but extent of DM disappearance was greater for WSB than for ESB (P < .10). In situ rate of forage NDF disappearance was decreased by protein supplementation (P = .10). In Exp. 2, 40 Polled Hereford and Red Angus x Simmental weanling steer calves were stratified by weight (average BW, 250 kg) and allotted randomly to one of two replications of the four treatments used in Exp. 1 (eight pens, five animals per pen). Forage DMI was not affected by treatment (P > .10). Average daily gain and feed efficiency were increased by supplementation (P < .05). Supplement source had no effect on intake or ADG (P > .10), but ESB tended to exhibit better feed efficiency than WSB (P = .10). In conclusion, WSB and ESB seem to be as effective as SBM+BAR protein supplements for growing beef cattle. In addition, WSB and ESB, at the levels used in these experiments, can be incorporated into diets for cattle consuming low-quality roughage without deleterious effects on fiber digestion or subsequent performance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8384196,1993,J Anim Sci,1.711,58
Cryptorchidism in North American cattle: breed predisposition and clinical findings.,"St Jean G, Gaughan EM, Constable PD.","The authors analyzed data collected over 26 years from 143 cryptorchid bulls admitted to 23 North American veterinary schools. Breed was found to be a risk factor. The medical records of 41 cryptorchid cattle were also obtained, and the physical examination findings, method of diagnosis, and surgical management were recorded. Polled Hereford and Shorthorn cattle were at significantly greater risk for cryptorchidism; however, polled cattle were not at an increased risk for cryptorchidism. Cryptorchidism was most commonly diagnosed by external palpation of the superficial inguinal rings and by palpation per rectum. Unilateral cryptorchidism appears to be more common than bilateral cryptorchidism. The incidence of cryptorchidism was 69% for the left testis and 31% for the right testis. Sixty-six percent of the retained testes were located in the inguinal canal. Cryptorchidectomy was performed through an inguinal, paramedian or flank approach in 26 bulls. Cryptorchidism appears to be rare in bovine bulls admitted to North American veterinary schools, with 1.7 cases per 1,000 bull admissions. We suggest that cryptorchidism be considered an inherited trait in the Shorthorn and Polled Hereford breeds.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16727193,1992,Theriogenology,2.136,25
Penile hematoma in bulls: 60 cases (1979-1990).,"Musser JM, St-Jean G, Vestweber JG, Pejsa TG.","Sixty bulls with penile hematomas were examined from 1979 through 1990. Thirty-eight bulls underwent surgical correction, 17 bulls were managed by medical treatment, and 5 bulls were not treated. Hereford and Polled Hereford breeds represented the majority (n = 37, 62%) of the bulls, with 10 other breeds representing the remainder (n = 21, 35%) in this study; breed was not reported in 2 bulls. Follow-up information was obtained from owners (40/60) through conversation on the success or failure of treatment, interval of sexual rest, duration of breeding soundness, and final outcome of the bull. Surgical correction was successful in 19 (70%) of 27 cases; medical treatment was successful in 6 (46%) of 13 cases. Of the 8 bulls that had penile hematomas with swelling measuring > 20 cm in width, 6 were successfully treated surgically, compared with 1 of 3 successfully treated medically. Of the bulls with penile hematomas having a swelling measuring < or = 20 cm in width, 7 of 9 were successfully treated surgically, compared with 4 of 5 successfully treated medically. Duration of the penile hematoma had little effect on the success of surgical correction.

Morphologic abnormalities found in erythroid precursors of all calves were associated with the nucleus. Rubriblast nuclei were irregular with numerous blebs, indentations, and deep clefts. Elongated blebs appeared as satellite nuclei in some sections. Nuclear membranes had numerous defects or gaps, which were frequently present in, but not limited to, recently divided cells. Cytoplasmic material could be found within these gaps and extending into the nucleus. Rubricytes had chromatin that was abnormally condensed and hyperosmiophilic, with numerous translucent vacuoles present. Binucleate rubricytes occurred frequently in affected calves. These changes resemble those of type I congenital dyserythropoiesis in human beings, and we suggest congenital anemia, dyskeratosis, and progressive alopecia of Polled Hereford calves as the appropriate diagnostic terms to describe this disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1621331,1992,Vet Pathol,1.795,6

Relationship between milk expected progeny differences of polled Hereford sires and actual milk production of their crossbred daughters.,"Diaz C, Notter DR, Beal WE.","One hundred sixteen spring-calving Polled Hereford x Angus cows were milked using milking machines after receiving 20 IU of oxytocin. Sires of the cows had been divergently selected on yearling weight (YW) and total maternal (MAT) EPD to form four groups: high YW, high MAT EPD; high YW, low MAT EPD; low YW, high MAT EPD; and low YW, low MAT EPD. Average milk production after 12-h calf separation was 3.7 +/- 1.3 kg. Actual milk production of cows was regressed on their sires' milk EPD, where the milk EPD estimates the additive maternal genetic contribution of a sire to the weaning weight of his daughters' calves. The regression of actual 12-h milk production on sire milk EPD was .038 +/- .014 kg/kg, and the correlation was .26 (P less than .006), close to its expected value, based on the accuracy of the prediction, heritability of the trait, and the relationship between sire and daughter. Extension of results of a single milking to an entire lactation is difficult, but over the range of sire milk EPD sampled (-10 to 16 kg), the range in daughters' milk production predicted from the regression analysis was 27% of the mean actual milk production, corresponding to an increase of about 1% more milk per kilogram of milk EPD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1548201,1992,J Anim Sci,1.711,40
"Congenital dyserythropoiesis and progressive alopecia in Polled Hereford calves: hematologic, biochemical, bone marrow cytologic, electrophoretic, and flow cytometric findings.","Steffen DJ, Elliott GS, Leipold HW, Smith JE.","Congenital dyserythropoiesis with dyskeratosis is a slow, progressive, and often fatal disease in Polled Hereford calves. Affected calves have a macrocytic normochromic anemia with a mild reticulocytosis. Studies indicate that calves are hyperferremic with increased saturation of serum total iron binding capacity, which rules out iron deficiency as a cause. Other secondary causes of dyserythropoiesis, including cobalamin and folate deficiencies, are unlikely because serum cobalamin and folate levels of affected calves were normal. Virus isolation was negative, and failure to identify bovine retroviral antigens or antibodies from several calves suggested that viral agents were not involved. Bone marrow cytologic findings were similar to those in congenital hereditary dyserythropoiesis in humans and included occasional multinucleate cells, internuclear chromatin bridging between nuclei of partially divided cells, and, more frequently, irregular nuclear shapes and chromatin patterns. DNA content and cell cycle distribution of erythroid cells appeared normal, and no electrophoretic abnormalities were detected in erythrocyte membrane proteins. The Polled Hereford syndrome is similar in many ways to type I congenital dyserythropoiesis in humans and may be an appropriate biomedical model for studying erythroid proliferation during dyserythropoiesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1348189,1992,J Vet Diagn Invest,1.219,14
Across-breed expected progeny differences: use of within-breed expected progeny differences to adjust breed evaluations for sire sampling and genetic trend.,"Notter DR, Cundiff LV.","Data on 2,034 F1 calves sired by Angus, Hereford, Polled Hereford, Charolais, Limousin, Simmental, Gelbvieh, and Tarentaise bulls with Hereford or Angus dams and data on 3,686 three-breed-cross calves with 700 F1 dams of the same breed crosses were used for this study. Traits analyzed were birth, weaning, yearling, and 420-d weights (BWT, WW, YW, and W420, respectively) of F1 calves and WW of three-breed-cross calves. Expected progeny differences from national cattle evaluation programs for sires of F1 calves and cows for BWT, WW, YW, and net maternal ability (milk) were used to assess their value in prediction of crossbred performance. Regressions of actual F1 calf performance on sire EPD were positive for BWT (1.09 +/- .12 kg/kg of BWT EPD), WW (.79 +/- .14 kg/kg of WW EPD), YW (1.44 +/- .16 kg/kg of YW EPD), and W420 (1.66 kg/kg of YW EPD). These regression coefficients were similar to the expected value of 1.0 for BWT and WW but were larger than expected for YW and W420. Regressions of actual three-breed-cross calf WW on milk and WW EPD of their maternal grandsires were .95 +/- .14 and .42 +/- .10 kg/kg, respectively, and differed little from their expectations of 1.0 and .5, respectively.

Mastitis in beef cows and its effects on calf weight gain.,"Newman MA, Wilson LL, Cash EH, Eberhart RJ, Drake TR.","Quarter milk samples from 51 purebred (Angus, Polled Hereford, and Simmental) and 69 crossbred (Angus x Simmental x Charolais three-way cross) beef cows were collected aseptically at three times during lactation to determine the prevalence of intramammary infection, milk somatic cell counts (SCC), and effects of infection on calf weight gain. Quarter infection prevalence was 13.1, 14.9, and 27.5% in early, mid, and late lactation; corresponding cow infection prevalence was 25.8, 29.2, and 54.4%. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 2.9, 2.7, and 3.2% of quarters in early, mid, and late lactation, respectively. Corynebacterium bovis, generally regarded as a minor pathogen, was isolated from 4.0, 7.6, and 18.2% of quarters at the three respective times. Geometric SCC means (10(3) cells/ml) were 1,522, 344, and 509 for S. aureus-infected quarters; 344, 899, and 221 for Staphylococcus hyicus-infected quarters; 65, 36, and 86 for C. bovis-infected quarters; and 20, 17, and 18 for uninfected quarters in early, mid, and late lactation, respectively. Adjusted 205-d weight gain for calves with S. aureus-infected dams was 9.6 kg less (P less than .05) than for calves with uninfected dams. Adjusted 205-d weight gain for calves with dams infected with any mastitis pathogen did not differ significantly from that of calves with uninfected dams. At weaning half of the infected cows and half of the uninfected cows were given an intramammary infusion product containing 300 mg of cephapirin benzathine in each quarter; the remaining cows were untreated controls. Quarter samples were collected aseptically from all cows 14 to 28 d after subsequent calving. Quarter prevalence of infection after calving was lower (P less than .05) in treated (8.2%) than in control (22.4%) cows.

Interactive response of the horn fly (Diptera: Muscidae) and selected breeds of beef cattle.,"Steelman CD, Brown AH Jr, Gbur EE, Tolley G.","Statistically significant differences were observed in the population density of the horn fly, Haematobia irritans irritans (L.), on different breeds of beef cattle. The European breed Chianina had a population density of horn flies generally less than or equal to 50% than that of the British cattle breeds (Angus, Hereford, Polled Hereford, and Red Poll) and another European breed (Charolais). Generally, no significant difference existed among numbers of horn flies on Hereford, Polled Hereford, and Red Poll cows in 1988 or among Angus, Hereford, Polled Hereford, and Red Poll cows in 1989. Factors other than color appeared to be involved in the selective process between the horn fly and its host. Population densities on two white European breeds (Charolais and Chianina) were significantly different on all weekly intervals except for 4 wk in both 1988 and 1989. No significant difference existed among Charolais and British breeds except during 4 wk in 1988 and 3 wk in 1989. When weaning weights of all calves were adjusted for the effects of age to 205 d, sex of calf, and age of dam, the indirect effect of the horn fly on weaning weight showed a significant linear regression.

Comparison of methods for predicting yearling scrotal circumference and correlations of scrotal circumference to growth traits in beef bulls.,"Pratt SL, Spitzer JC, Webster HW, Hupp HD, Bridges WC Jr.","From 1981 through 1986, BW, hip height, and scrotal circumference (SC) measurements were obtained on 329 bulls at the start of a 140-d gain test (SOT) and every 28 d to the end of test (EOT). Age, overall ADG, weight per day of age, ADG by period, and SC growth (cm/d) were calculated. Data were analyzed in two data sets because age of dam (AOD) and birth weights were unavailable between 1981 and 1983. Correlations of SC to other traits measured and probabilities for bulls attaining 30 or 32 cm SC by 365 d of age were calculated. Two adjusted 365-d SC (365-d SC) were calculated for each individual from regression analysis and from the following formula: 365-d SC = [(SCEOT-SCSOT)/140 d] x [365-ageSOT] + SCSOT. Except for ADG in Data Set 2, breed group differences (P less than .05) were observed for correlations of SC to all growth traits, age, and AOD. To attain 30 cm SC by 365 d of age with nearly 100% probability, Angus, Simmental and Zebu-derived bulls needed a 23-cm SCSOT, whereas continental (other than Simmental) and Polled Hereford bulls required a 26-cm SCSOT.

"Evaluation of feed conversion in steers from a diallel of Simmental, Limousin, Polled Hereford, and Brahman beef cattle.","Comerford JW, Cooper JB, Benyshek LL, Bertrand JK.","A total of 269 steers produced in a four-breed diallel mating design of Simmental, Limousin, Polled Hereford, and Brahman breeds were evaluated for the unadjusted and maintenance-adjusted total feed intake to total weight gain ratio. Time on feed ranged from 184 to 251 d. Covariate adjustments were made separately for age- and 12th rib fat-constant end points. Purebred, general combining ability, and maternal effects and heterosis were estimated. Effects of year, breed of dam, slaughter group, and days on feed accounted for most of the variation in feed conversion. Significantly higher unadjusted cumulative feed/gain ratios were found for steers from Brahman sires and for those from Simmental, Limousin, and Brahman dams. Adjustment to either fat- or age-constant values did not rerank breed groups, but a small reduction in the differences between these groups was detected for fat-constant efficiency. For maintenance-adjusted feed intake, progeny of Simmental and Limousin dams were less efficient than those of Polled Hereford and Brahman dams. Negative values for general combining ability, maternal effects, and heterosis would indicate less feed required per unit of weight gain. General combining ability for Polled Hereford crosses was negative and significant for cumulative feed/gain ratios, but no difference among dam breeds was found for the maintenance-adjusted ratio. Maternal effects for Limousin dams were positive and significant for all maintenance-adjusted ratios. Heterosis estimates for specific breed crosses were generally negative and ranged from -.87 to .22.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1885389,1991,J Anim Sci,1.711,6
Body measurements of crossbred calves sired by Simmental bulls divergently selected for progeny first-calf calving ease in relation to birth weight.,"Nugent RA 3rd, Notter DR.","Simmental bulls (n = 27) were divergently selected on linear model first-calf calving ease expected progeny difference (CEPD) relative to birth weight expected progeny difference (BEPD) so that body measures of calves from sires whose progeny tended to be born either with more or less dystocia than expected from BEPD could be obtained. At birth, calf weight, head circumference, shoulder width, hip width, heart girth, cannon bone circumference and length, and body length were recorded for 204 calves. These measures had also been obtained from the Polled Hereford X Angus dams of the calves at their births. Sire differences (P less than .05) existed for calf cannon bone circumference and length before and after adjustment for gestation length and birth weight of the calf. Sire BEPD was positively associated with cannon and head circumferences independent of phenotypic birth weight and gestation length. No relationship existed between CEPD or threshold model first-calf calving ease expected progeny difference and any calf measure, either before or after adjustment for birth weight. Multivariate factor analysis was used to describe independent components of skeletal width, frame, and thickness after removal of birth weight effects; factors were not related to genetic merit for calving ease or observed calving performance. Independent of weight, newborn calf measures were not highly related to body measures at weaning or to dam birth measures. Body shape differences at constant weight existed in crossbred calves, but they were not related to sire genetic merit for calving ease or measured dystocia.

Calf birth weight, head circumference, shoulder width, hip width, heart girth, cannon bone circumference and length, and body length were recorded at 24 h postpartum. Sire birth weight EPD was positively associated (P less than .05) with all calf measures but only with head and cannon circumference after adjustment for phenotypic birth weight and gestation length. Thus, at constant birth weight, calves from higher birth weight EPD bulls tended to have larger cannon and head circumferences. Calving ease EPD was negatively related (P less than .05) to all calf measures except shoulder width. After adjustment for birth weight, only cannon circumference was associated with calving ease EPD, and this effect was removed by additional adjustment for birth weight EPD. Thus, at constant birth weight, bulls with higher EPD for calving ease sired calves with smaller cannon circumference, but at constant birth weight EPD, body measures were not associated with calving ease EPD. Factor analysis defined underlying skeletal width and frame components of shape (independent of birth weight) for both sire breeds. Calf shape differed among sires and was in part explained by birth weight EPD. No additional variation in shape was explained by calving ease EPD.

Only bulls that were 300 to 452 d of age, 325 to 640 kg, and were in consignments offering more than nine bulls per breed were included in the analyses. Because the subsets of Angus, Polled Hereford, and Simmental bulls had large numbers of observations (817, 271, and 449, respectively), individual adjustment coefficients were determined for each breed. Angus, Polled Hereford, and Simmental bulls had pelvic area adjustment regressions on age of .20, .32, and .20 cm2/d, respectively, and regressions on body weight of .15, .22, and .18 cm2/kg, respectively. Homogeneous linear responses of all breeds (11 breeds including Angus, Polled Hereford, and Simmental) were combined to form all-breed coefficients for age and weight adjustments, which were .21 cm2/d and .15 cm2/kg, respectively. Weight or age adjustments can be used to compare contemporaries for relative pelvic area differences, but both should not be used on the same bull. Although many factors contribute to dystocia, high priority should be given to identifying sires of replacement heifers of low to moderate birth weight genotype and above average pelvic area genotype.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1885346,1991,J Anim Sci,1.711,13
"Congenital anemia, dyskeratosis, and progressive alopecia in Polled Hereford calves.","Steffen DJ, Leipold HW, Gibb J, Smith JE.","A new syndrome of anemia, alopecia, and dyskeratosis was identified in Polled Hereford calves in this study. Cutaneous changes included hyperkeratosis and hair loss around the muzzle and ear margins, which progressed to a generalized alopecia and hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Histologically, orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis with dyskeratosis of epidermal and follicular keratinocytes was present. Alopecia was correlated with dyskeratosis of Huxley's layer and an increasing proportion of follicles in the telogen phase of the hair cycle. Dermatitis was characterized by a mild dermal mononuclear cell infiltrate and mild lymphocytic perivascular dermatitis. The anemia present at birth was nonprogressive and was classified as normochromic and normocytic to macrocytic. Reticulocytosis was absent, but bone marrow was markedly hyperplastic. Nuclear cytoplasmic asynchrony of the rubricyte and metarubricyte stages occurred in the bone marrow. Abnormal rubricyte nuclei and maturation arrest at the late rubricyte stage were common. Cytologic features of the erythroid series are similar to those of type I congenital dyserythropoietic anemia of human beings. Genealogic features suggest that this is a primary hereditary defect. The mode of inheritance, however, remains to be determined.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1858254,1991,Vet Pathol,1.795,24
Effects of trenbolone acetate on carcass characteristics and serum testosterone and cortisol concentrations in bulls and steers on different management and implant schemes.,"Jones SJ, Johnson RD, Calkins CR, Dikeman ME.","The objective of this study was to determine the effects of different implanting schemes on serum testosterone and cortisol concentrations, and carcass traits of bulls and steers implanted with trenbolone acetate (TBA) and zeranol (Z). Twenty Polled Hereford bulls were randomly assigned to one of three treatments after birth. Five calves served as nonimplanted control bulls (NIB). Nine bulls were implanted (IB) with 140 mg of TBA and 36 mg of Z at about 1 mo of age and reimplanted with both compounds 10 wk later. When IB calves were about 21 wk of age, the TBA implant was removed and calves were reimplanted with Z every 10 wk until slaughter. Six calves were castrated at 3 wk of age and implanted (IS) with TBA and Z every 10 wk until slaughter. Blood samples from each animal were obtained at 14-d intervals beginning at 14 wk of age and serum cortisol (C) and testosterone (T) concentrations were determined. The NIB had higher C levels than IB or IS (P less than .05) during the preweaning period. During the finishing period, there were no differences in C concentrations between NIB and IB; however, IS had lower levels (P less than .05) than both bull treatments. Serum T concentrations began to increase about 12 wk later (42 vs 30 wk, respectively) in IB compared with NIB. Testicular size was smaller (P less than .05) in IB than in NIB. No differences (P greater than .05) were observed in carcass characteristics. Taste-panel scores were not different among treatments. In conclusion, implanting schemes using TBA and Z lowered serum levels of C and delayed puberty in bulls; however, they did not alter carcass characteristics or eating quality.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2071500,1991,J Anim Sci,1.711,23
Inability to predict the adult sexual performance of bulls by prepuberal sexual behaviors.,"Price EO, Wallach SJ.","The objective of this investigation was to determine the extent to which the sexual performance of adult bulls (18 to 24 mo of age) can be predicted by prepuberal sexual behaviors. Tests were administered to 121 polled Hereford bulls to determine whether adult sexual performance (especially serving capacity or ejaculation rate) was related to 1) whether or not the subjects mounted estrous females at 6 mo of age, 2) the age at which the bulls attained their first ejaculation, 3) the frequency of sexual behaviors exhibited in heterosexual interactions and 4) the frequency of male-male mounting exhibited in all-male groups. None of the above measures reliably predicted adult serving capacity. Prepuberal interest in mounting other males and estrous females and the age at which ejaculatory competence was attained bore little relationship to serving capacity at 18 to 24 mo. Individual differences in rate of ejaculation were consistent from one age to another only after the bulls had reached 18 mo. We concluded that the sexual behaviors of prepuberal beef bulls were of limited usefulness in predicting adult sexual performance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2061235,1991,J Anim Sci,1.711,4
Effects of group size and the male-to-female ratio on the sexual performance and aggressive behavior of bulls in serving capacity tests.,"Price EO, Wallach SJ.","The purpose of the following study was to determine the effects of group size and the male-to-female ratio on the sexual and aggressive behaviors of bulls in the context of serving capacity tests. Tests were administered to two groups of 13 and 14 polled Hereford bulls, respectively, under four test conditions in which the number of bulls and the ratio of males to females was varied. The test conditions were as follows: 1) individual tests (single males were exposed to single females), 2) small-group tests (three or four bulls:three females), 3) large-group tests (13 or 14 bulls:3 females), and 4) male-only test (13 or 14 bulls were placed in the test area in the absence of females). In addition, the sexual performance of 44 Hereford and 12 Angus bulls was compared when competing (small-group tests) vs not competing (individual tests) for females. Ejaculation rate (serving capacity) was similar in individual and small-group tests in which a male-to-female ratio of approximately 1:1 was maintained. Increasing the male-to-female ratio to approximately 4.5:1 enhanced levels of aggression and reduced overall sexual performance. Angus bulls were more aggressive than their Hereford counterparts when competing for females and exhibited lower (P less than .05) ejaculation rates in small-group tests than when evaluated individually. We concluded that the sexual performance of polled Hereford bulls can be reliably evaluated when tested in small groups as long as a 1:1 male-to-female ratio is approximated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2061234,1991,J Anim Sci,1.711,17
Molecular defects in the E1 alpha subunit of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex that cause maple syrup urine disease.,"Zhang B, Zhao Y, Harris RA, Crabb DW.","Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) results from an inborn metabolic error caused by a deficiency of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC). cDNA clones encoding the E1 alpha subunit of BCKDC from rat and human liver have been isolated and characterized. The chromosomal location of E1 alpha on chromosome 19q13.1-13.2 has been determined using complementary methods. The etiology of MSUD has been studied by determining the enzyme activity, protein mass and mRNA level of BCKDC in fibroblasts from a human family and Polled Hereford calves, both with classic MSUD. A TACTyr to AACAsn substitution at residue 394 of the E1 alpha subunit was identified in the human patient by using enzymatic amplification of mRNA followed by DNA sequencing. Amplification of both mRNA and genomic DNA, in combination with allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, demonstrated that the patient was a compound heterozygote, inheriting an allele with a structural mutation from the father, and an allele from the mother containing a presumably cis-acting defect in regulation that abolished the expression of one of the E1 alpha alleles. The results revealed for the first time that a case of MSUD was caused by structural and regulatory mutations involving the E1 alpha subunit. Recent studies by others have demonstrated that the same structural mutation as is found in this patient is responsible for the high incidence of MSUD in the Philadelphia Mennonite population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1943689,1991,Mol Biol Med,Not Found,19
Effect of dietary energy restriction on metabolic and endocrine responses during the estrous cycle of the suckled beef cow.,"Schrick FN, Spitzer JC, Jenkins TC, Henricks DM, Althen TG.","A replicated trial was conducted with suckled Angus and Polled Hereford cows (110 d postcalving) to determine metabolic and endocrine responses to an energy-restricted diet after cows had re-established postpartum estrous cyclicity. Cows were individually fed 26.5 Mcal ME (H) or 15.2 Mcal ME (L) for a 30-d preliminary period and fitted with an indwelling jugular cannula at synchronized estrus. Average daily weight change during the estrous cycle was .60 +/- .25 and -1.37 +/- .30 kg/d for H and L, respectively (P less than .05). Blood concentrations of cortisol, progesterone and LH during the estrous cycle were not affected by diet, nor did diet affect frequency or amplitude of LH pulses (P greater than .05). No dietary differences were observed for daily concentrations of total protein, glucose, nonesterified fatty acids or acetate. Mean blood concentrations of propionate and butyrate were not different between diets; however, L cows had lower concentrations of propionate and butyrate on d 11 of the cycle (P less than .05). Cows fed L had higher concentrations of blood urea nitrogen (P less than .05), but they had lower concentrations of cholesterol (P less than .05) on d 4, 11, 18 and subsequent estrus (E). Insulin was not different on d 4 and 11; however, cows fed L had lower insulin concentrations on d 18 and d E (P less than .05). Dietary energy restriction in these cyclic cows caused no change in endocrine responses.

Subsequent reproduction and calf performance of nonpregnant cows compared with pregnant cows and replacement females.,"Neville WE Jr, Richardson KL, Williams DJ 3rd, Mullinix BG Jr, Utley PR.","This study was conducted with Angus, Polled Hereford and Santa Gertrudis straightbred and crossbred cows. The subsequent cow breeding and calf performance of cows that were nonpregnant (NP) were compared with cows that were pregnant (PG) at the time calves were weaned. All NP cows had a calf the year previous to their being nonpregnant. They were diagnosed as physically sound with no detection (by rectal palpation) of an abnormal reproductive tract. The NP and PG cows were aged 4 to 9 yr. Also, the NP cows were compared with replacement females exposed to calve first as 2- and 3-yr-olds (H2 and H3, respectively), and with cows exposed for second calving as 3-yr-olds (C2). Cows were assigned within breed composition and age to sire breeding groups on pasture. Subsequent calving and weaning rates were similar for NP, PG and H2 cows, similar for H3 and H2 cows and lowest (P less than .05) for C2 cows. Calves from NP and H3 cows were born earlier (P less than .05) in the calving period than calves from PG and H2 cows, whereas calves from C2 cows were born later (P less than .05) than those from NP, PG and H3 cows. Calving difficulty was similar for NP, PG and C2 and greatest (P less than .05) for H2 cows.

Growth of crossbred progeny of polled Hereford sires divergently selected for yearling weight and maternal ability.,"Mahrt GS, Notter DR, Beal WE, McClure WH, Bettison LG.","Polled Hereford sires (n = 47) were divergently selected on published yearling weight (YW) and maternal (MAT) expected progeny differences (EPD) and mated to grade Angus cows to produce 457 calves in five spring calf crops. Sires selected for high and low YW differed by an average of 6.3 kg in YW EPD and those selected for high and low MAT differed by an average of 4.0 kg in MAT EPD based on 1989 EPD values. Calves by high-YW sires were heavier at birth (2.2 kg; P less than .10) and weaning (7.5 kg; P less than .01) and as yearlings (16.4 kg; P less than .01) than calves by low-YW sires and were taller at weaning (1.90 cm; P less than .01). Regressions of calf performance on corresponding 1989 EPD were 1.18 +/- .20 kg/kg for birth weight, .75 +/- .24 kg/kg for weaning weight and 1.79 +/- .42 kg/kg for YW. Expected progeny differences for individual sires were calculated from the data collected in this study and had correlations with published EPD of .53 for birth weight, .37 for weaning weight and .54 for YW. These corresponded to expected correlations based on accuracies of evaluation of .68, .61 and .58, respectively, and yielded estimates of the genetic correlation between performance in the environment of the study and the environment of the purebred herds where the published EPD were derived of .78 for birth weight, .61 for weaning weight and .93 for YW. The very large regression of YW on YW EPD (1.79 +/- .42 kg/kg) may have resulted from bias in published EPD due to culling of calves at weaning in purebred herds. Use of multiple traits analyses to account for such culling is recommended.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2384382,1990,J Anim Sci,1.711,17

Premature translation termination of the pre-E1 alpha subunit of the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase as a cause of maple syrup urine disease in Polled Hereford calves.,"Zhang B, Healy PJ, Zhao Y, Crabb DW, Harris RA.","Maple syrup urine disease in man and cattle is an inborn metabolic error caused by the deficiency of the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase. We have studied the molecular basis of the disease in Polled Hereford calves. The E1 component of branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase was virtually undetectable by Western blot analysis of fibroblasts from an affected calf. Northern blot analysis failed to detect the E1 alpha mRNA species in the fibroblasts. Nevertheless, it was readily demonstrated by reverse transcription of RNA followed by polymerase chain reaction that the mRNA for the E1 alpha subunit was present in the cells, albeit at very low concentrations. Sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction-generated cDNA for the entire coding region of the E1 alpha subunit revealed a single base substitution at codon -6 (CAG to TAG). This mutation introduces a stop codon in the leader peptide of the E1 alpha subunit, resulting in the premature termination of translation. The mutation was verified by hybridization of the amplified cDNA fragments from two affected calves with allele-specific oligonucleotides. This finding explains the pathogenesis of maple syrup urine disease in this breed of cattle, which provides the only known animal model for the human disease. In addition, the results provide evidence for the effect of premature translation termination on reducing the steady-state mRNA level and the dependence of E1 beta protein stability on the co-expression of the E1 alpha.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2303405,1990,J Biol Chem,4.01,52
Regulation of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase and elucidation of a molecular basis for maple syrup urine disease.,"Harris RA, Zhang B, Goodwin GW, Kuntz MJ, Shimomura Y, Rougraff P, Dexter P, Zhao Y, Gibson R, Crabb DW.","The hepatic branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex plays an important role in regulating branched-chain amino acid levels. These compounds are essential for protein synthesis but toxic if present in excess. When dietary protein is deficient, the hepatic enzyme is converted to the inactive, phosphorylated state to conserve branched-chain amino acids for protein synthesis. When dietary protein is excessive, the enzyme is in the active, dephosphorylated state to commit the excess branched-chain amino acids to degradation. Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide, even when the animal is starving for dietary protein, results in activation of the hepatic branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex to prevent accumulation of branched-chain amino acids. Likewise, the increase in branched-chain amino acids caused by body wasting during starvation and uncontrolled diabetes is blunted by activation of the hepatic branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. The activity state of the complex is regulated in the short term by the concentration of branched-chain alpha-ketoacids (inhibitors of branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase) and in the long term by alteration in total branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase activity. cDNAs have been cloned and the primary structure of the mature proteins deduced for the E1 alpha subunit of the human and rat liver branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. The cDNA and protein sequences are highly conserved for the two species. Considerable sequence similarity is also apparent between the E1 alpha subunits of the human branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Maple syrup urine disease is caused by an inherited deficiency in the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. The molecular basis of one maple syrup urine disease family has been determined for the first time. The patient was found to be a compound heterozygote, inheriting an allele encoding an abnormal E1 alpha from the father, and an allele which is not expressed from the mother. The only known animal model for the disease (Polled Hereford cattle) has also been characterized. The mutation in these animals introduces a stop codon in the leader peptide of the E1 alpha subunit, resulting in premature termination of translation. Two thiamine responsive patients have been studied. The deduced amino acid sequences of the mature E1 alpha subunit and its leader sequence were normal, suggesting that the defect in these patients must exist in some other subunit of the complex. 3-Hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase and methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, two enzymes of the valine catabolic pathway, were purified from liver tissue and characterized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2403034,1990,Adv Enzyme Regul,Not Found,81

A numerator relationship matrix for sires of cows was incorporated into the sire model to account for relationships among sires. Variation among years significantly affected pregnancy rate in all three breeds. Age of dam significantly affected pregnancy rate in the Angus and Hereford groups.

The PH-A replicates calved 3.5 d earlier (P less than .05) and had 7.3 percentage units higher (P less than .01) CR than PH-SG replicates. Results of this study indicated that 80-cow two-sire breeding groups had an advantage over the 40-cow single-sire groups in terms of calves born earlier in the calving period, with no reduction in CR.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3667458,1987,J Anim Sci,1.711,10
Cow breeding and calf growth performance as affected by pregnancy status the previous year.,"Neville WE Jr, Richardson KL, Williams DJ 3rd, Utley PR.","A 2-yr study was conducted to compare the subsequent cow breeding and calf performance of cows that were nonpregnant with cows that were pregnant at the time calves were weaned. Cows were Angus (A), Polled Hereford (PH), Santa Gertrudis (SG) straightbreds and crossbreds of these breeds. Nonpregnant cows (G1) were 4- to 9-yr-olds that had a calf the previous year and appeared to be physically sound with no detection (by rectal palpation) of an abnormal reproductive tract due to disease, abnormal growth or calving difficulties. Pregnant cows (G2) were of similar age and breed composition to G1 cows. The 93 G1 and the 193 G2 cows were assigned within age and breed composition to sire breeding groups on pasture in an approximate 1:2 ratio, respectively, per sire. There were six A, three PH and one SG sires. The year prior to G1 cows being nonpregnant, G1 cows calved 11 d later (P less than .01) than G2 cows. Subsequent to their being nonpregnant, G1 cows gained 27 kg more (P less than .001) weight during the breeding period, had 5.4 percentage units more (P less than .29) calves born, had calves 17 d earlier (P less than .001) in the calving period, had calves that gained at a similar rate to weaning and had calves that were 14 kg heavier (P less than .01) at weaning (due to their being 17 d older) compared with G2 cows and calves.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3624088,1987,J Anim Sci,1.711,6
"Growth, feed efficiency and variation of individually fed Angus, polled Hereford and Holstein steers.",Thonney ML.,"Individual growth and feed intake of 36 Angus, 27 Polled Hereford and 30 Holstein steers were determined from 365 to 560 kg live weight. One-half of the cattle in each breed were fed a diet based on high-moisture ear corn and the other one-half were fed a diet based on corn silage. Within each breed X diet group, half of the cattle were implanted with zeranol. Cattle fed the high-moisture ear corn diet were 8% more (P less than .01) efficient than cattle fed the corn silage diet. Cattle implanted with zeranol consumed 9% more (P less than .005) dry matter and gained 15% (P less than .005) faster, resulting in 5% (P less than .05) less dry matter per unit gain than unimplanted cattle. Holstein steers gained 11% faster (P less than .005) and consumed 8% less (P less than .025) dry matter per unit gain than the average of Angus and Polled Hereford steers. Within subclass coefficients of variation were 9.9, 14.3 and 13.7 for daily dry matter intake, average daily gain and dry matter per unit gain, respectively; within subclass correlations were .50 (P less than .01), .17 and -.75 (P less than .01) between daily dry matter intake and average daily gain, daily dry matter intake and dry matter per unit gain and average daily gain and dry matter per unit gain. When combined with previous data that show Holsteins attain the Choice grade with less trimmable fat and equal weight of trimmed primal cuts compared with traditional beef breeds of the same live weight, these results suggest that Holstein steers are under-valued feedlot beef cattle.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3610863,1987,J Anim Sci,1.711,25
"Reproductive rates, birth weight, calving ease and 24-h calf survival in a four-breed diallel among Simmental, Limousin, Polled Hereford and Brahman beef cattle.","Comerford JW, Bertrand JK, Benyshek LL, Johnson MH.","Calving and weaning rates, birth weight, calving ease, and 24-h calf survival were evaluated in a four-breed diallel of Simmental (S), Limousin (L), Polled Hereford (H) and Brahman (B) beef cattle in five calf crops. Limousin dams tended to have the highest calving and weaning rates because they were able to have heavier calves with less calving difficulty and higher survival rates. Brahman-sired calves were the heaviest at birth (P less than .05) and B dams produced the lightest calves (P less than .001). Lower birth weights tended to be the limiting factor on survival of these calves. A linear comparison among means to evaluate purebred, additive, maternal and specific combining ability effects showed most of the reduction in birth weight from B dams was due to maternal effects. Breed of dam accounted for a higher proportion of variation in calving ease than did sire breed. Simmental sires had significantly heavier calves at birth and S and H dams tended to have more calving difficulty and lower survival rates. Heterosis for these traits was generally not significant. Correlations were generally positive and significant for birth weight and calving ease, but were more variable for birth weight and survival. Linear regressions of calving ease on birth weight both within years and within dam-breed-year subclasses were very similar in that the association of these two traits was reduced as dam age increased.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3818492,1987,J Anim Sci,1.711,58
"Calfhood weights, body measurements and measures of fatness versus criteria of overall size and shape for predicting yearling performance in beef cattle.","Hammack SP, Shrode RR.","Data were collected over a period of 4 yr from bulls and heifers of two location-breed groups (East Tennessee-Polled Hereford, Cumberland Plateau-Angus). Variables measured and recorded at the time all calves were weaned (at an average age of approximately 230 d) were age (in d at time of data collection; AGE), weight (WT), visual condition score (COND), ultrasonically measured subcutaneous fat thickness (FAT), body length (LT), heart girth (HG) and hip width (HIP). These variables were included in principal-components (PC) analyses. The first principal component (PC1) was a measure of overall size, accounting for 66 to 69% of the total variation. Remaining principal components contrasted body shapes. Stepwise multiple regression analyses (separate for each location-sex subgroup) were conducted using various combinations of the weaning variables listed above, or principal components of these variables, to predict birth to yearling average daily gain (BYADG), weaning to yearling average daily gain (WYADG) and yearling condition score (YCOND). Condition score (COND) appeared to be the most valuable complement to AGE and WT, with LT somewhat useful also. In equations including principal components, after AGE, PC1 most frequently entered first, generally followed by PC2. Coefficients of multiple determination (R2) were largest for BYADG (greater than .50), followed by YCOND (.15 to .50) and WYADG (less than .15). Longer-bodied, thinner-fleshed animals of a given age and weight tended to have larger gains and smaller YCOND.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3759681,1986,J Anim Sci,1.711,15

None of the affected calves were seen to stand after birth and when first examined the calves were in lateral recumbency, with extension and crossing of the hindlimbs. All the affected calves were bright and alert, could lift their heads and apparently could see and hear. When the calves were encouraged to stand spontaneous and stimulus-responsive myoclonic extensor spasms, with whole body rigidity, were consistently observed. Thirty-two of the affected calves had macroscopic lesions in the coxae. No significant pathological or biochemical lesions were observed in the central nervous system of any of the calves. The water content of the cerebellum did not differ between normal and affected calves. As oedema of the central nervous system is not a feature of this condition it is more appropriate to describe it as inherited congenital myoclonus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3750776,1986,Vet Rec,2.05,34

The similarity of the clinical signs of dullness, recumbency and opisthotonos, and the observation of severe status spongiosus within the central nervous system, indicated that this condition had probably affected seven other newborn calves.

Hepatic enzyme changes in bovine hepatogenous photosensitivity caused by water-damaged alfalfa hay.,"Putnam MR, Qualls CW, Rice LE, Dawson LJ, Edwards WC.","In the winter of 1983, practitioners reported extensive photosensitization in 7 herds of cattle. All herds had a history of having been fed water-damaged alfalfa hay. A cow from one herd was referred to the veterinary teaching hospital at Oklahoma State University. In this herd of approximately 40 adult Polled Herefords, all cattle had had some degree of clinical involvement over the past 4 to 6 weeks. Clinical signs included scaling and erythema of sparsely haired skin, muzzle, and teats, as well as icterus, anorexia, and weight loss. One cow died, and the remaining cattle recovered over an 8- to 10-week period after removal of the hay from the ration. In the referred cow, values for total and conjugated bilirubin, BUN, creatinine, sorbitol dehydrogenase, serum alkaline phosphatase, serum aspartate transaminase, and serum gamma-glutamyl transferase were higher than normal. In the herd of origin, extremely high serum gamma-glutamyl transferase values (180 to 1,400 IU/L) persisted (normal, 2 to 35 IU/L). Feeding the same alfalfa hay to 2 clinically normal cows reproduced the syndrome.

Trends of performance in Arkansas cooperative beef-bull performance tests from 1962 through 1982.,"Simpson JD, Brown AH, Brown CJ.","Individual records of performance of 2787 bulls in cooperative beef-bull performance tests from 1962 through 1982 were analyzed to determine trends in final weight, average daily gain, daily feed consumption and gross feed efficiency. Data from Angus, Polled Hereford, Charolais, Hereford and Santa Gertrudis breeds were analyzed separately. Performance-test procedures and the ration fed remained the same in all tests. Least-squares means by year, adjusted for location of test, initial weight, initial age and initial condition score, were regressed on time to determine average yearly change in the traits. Yearly changes for Angus, Polled Hereford, Charolais, Hereford and Santa Gertrudis breeds in final weight were 3.3, 1.6, 3.3, 2.5, and 2.6 kg, respectively; in average daily gain and yearly changes were .02, .01, .02, .02, and .02 kg, respectively; in daily feed consumption the yearly changes were .08, .03, .09, and .04 kg, respectively; and in feed per kg gain the yearly changes were -.08, -.04, -.05, -.03, and -.07 kg, respectively.

Sire X environment interactions in beef cattle weaning weight field data.,"Bertrand JK, Berger PJ, Willham RL.","Weaning weight field records, supplied by the American Polled Hereford Association, were used to examine sire X environment interactions. Sire X herd/region and sire X contemporary group/herd interactions were evaluated from a data set containing 19,503 records.

The genetic correlations of sire progeny performance across contemporary groups/herd were .59 and .37 across herds and contemporary groups/region. The average genetic correlation of sire progeny performance across regions was .64. Heritability of weaning weight was .11 across regions, .17 within region and .28 within herd. Mixed-model sire analyses of Polled Hereford weaning weight field records should include sire X herd/region and sire X contemporary group/herd random effects to reduce the sire X environment effects particular to any herd or contemporary group, and to account for the distribution of sire progeny across herds and contemporary groups in the estimation of prediction error variance.

Comparative performance of straightbred and crossbred (F1) sires.,"Neville WE Jr, Utley PR, McCormick WC.","The first phase of this study was the production of contemporary straightbred (SB) and reciprocal crossbred (F1) bulls by mating Angus (A) bulls to A and Santa Gertrudis (SG) cows and SG bulls to SG and A cows. Of the bulls produced during the 4-yr period, those used for breeding included 15 A, 15 SG, 8 A X SG and 8 SG X A. For 205-d weight and weight/day of age (W/DA) postweaning, A X SG had higher (P less than .05) performance than SG X A bulls and SG had higher (P less than .05) performance than A bulls. There was no difference (P greater than .05) between SG and A X SG for 205-d weight, postweaning average daily gain (ADG) or postweaning W/DA. Heterosis estimates were 5.2 (P less than .10), 9.9 (P less than .01) and 5.8% (P less than .01) for 205-d weight, postweaning ADG and W/DA, respectively. The second phase of this study was the comparison of SB and F1 bulls for reproductive and progeny performance by exposing them as yearlings to 25 Polled Hereford cows each. There were no differences (P greater than .05) among the four sire groups for proportion of cows exposed that had a calf, had a live calf or weaned a calf. Reproductive performance of sires also was evaluated in terms of number of days (NOD) from the beginning of the breeding period until calves were born. The NOD for calves by SG was greater (P less than .05) than for calves by A or F1 sires. Compared with calves from SB sires, the NOD for calves from A X SG and SG X A sires were 5.0 and 10.6 d (P less than .05) lower. Differences among sires within year and breeding of sire were significant for all preweaning traits and for W/DA postweaning of their progeny.

Observations on spiral deviation of the penis in beef bulls.,"Blockey MA, Taylor EG.","Premature spiral deviation of the penis was investigated in 1083 British breed beef bulls in 42 herds in Victoria (35) and Western Australia (7) by means of the serving capacity test. The herd prevalence was 60%. The prevalence of the defect at the initial test for all bulls was 10%. The prevalence in 635 polled bulls was 16% compared to a prevalence of 1% in 448 horned bulls. The breed prevalence and the number of bulls tested per breed was Red Poll 27% (15), Murray Grey 25% (4), Poll Shorthorn 21% (34), Angus 17% (415), Poll Hereford 10% (167) and Hereford 1% (448). The difference between the last 2 breed types was highly significant (P less than 0.001). The prevalence of the defect increased from 0 to 30% over 9 years in one Victorian herd. The age of affected bulls varied from 2 to 11 years with most affected bulls aged from 3 to 6 years. Common ancestry was found between affected bulls in Western Australia, providing circumstantial evidence that it may be an inherited defect. None of the 103 affected bulls examined in this study had suffered obvious injury to the penis or prepuce. Eighty per cent of 56 affected bulls from Victoria had low serving capacity. Four bulls (2 from each state) with moderate to severe spiral deviation of the penis attained pregnancy rates of 43%, 33%, 3% and 3% respectively, in single sire mating trials.

Grading and rotational crossbreeding of beef cattle. II. Calf performance to weaning.,"Neville WE Jr, Mullinix BG Jr, McCormick WC.","Purebred Angus (A), Polled Hereford (PH) and Santa Gertrudis (SG) bulls were mated to grades, two-breed and three-breed rotational crosses of these breeds (seven herds) to produce three generations (G1, G2, G3) of calves. Birth weight and weaning traits were evaluated for herd differences, heterosis and effects of various genetic components. For each generation, the mean birth weight of SG exceeded that of PH which exceeded A (P less than .05). Averaged over generations, A and PH performed similarly for daily gain, 205-d weight and 205-d weight/cow exposed while SG exceeded A and PH for these traits. For feeder score, the breeds ranked A, PH, SG. For birth weight, daily gain, 205-d weight and 205-d weight/cow exposed, breeds ranked SG, PH, A for average additive genetic effects on the traits. Heterozygotic effects due to breed crosses, averaged over the three generations, were positive for all traits and generally significant, with PH X SG displaying more heterosis than the other two crosses. The maternal effects for A and SG were greater than PH for all traits except birth weight. Of the traits studied, from 12 (205-d wt/cow exposed) to 52% (205-d wt) of the variation averaged over generations was accounted for by a partial regression model that determined breed additive, breed maternal, heterosis and average maternal heterosis effects. Also averaged over generations, from .3 (205-d wt/cow exposed) to 1.7% (avg daily gain) additional variation was due to factors that may have included specific maternal heterosis, epistasis and linkage.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6698905,1984,J Anim Sci,1.711,17
Grading and rotational crossbreeding of beef cattle. I. Reproductive performance.,"Neville WE Jr, Mullinix BG Jr, McCormick WC.","Purebred Angus (A), Polled Hereford (PH) and Santa Gertrudis (SG) bulls were mated to grades, two-breed and three-breed rotational crosses of these breeds (seven herds) to produce three generations (G1, G2 and G3) of calves. The grade A and PH cows were higher in A and PH breeding, respectively, than grade SG cows were in SG breeding. Reproductive performance among grade and rotational-cross herds was evaluated for herd differences, heterosis and effects of various genetic components. For cows that produced G1 calves, the proportion of cows that calved, had a live calf and weaned a calf was higher (P less than .01) for those that calved compared with those that failed to calve the previous year. For cows that produced G2 and G3 calves, previous year's calving status did not affect (P greater than .05) reproductive performance. Grade A and PH were similar (P greater than .05) in reproductive performance during G1, G2 and G3. As generations advanced, SG decreased in reproductive performance. Except for the PH-SG rotational cross in G3, the A, PH and all two-breed rotational crosses and the three-breed rotational cross generally were similar (P greater than .05) for the three reproductive traits during each generation. Within generations, reproductive performance was similar (P greater than .05) between rotations within each of the two-breed rotational cross herds. For the three-breed rotational cross herd, differences due to rotation generally were not significant during G1 and G2, but for G3, the SG sires were associated with lower (P less than .05) reproductive performance for each of the three reproductive traits compared with A and PH sires. Heterosis percentages generally were positive but not significant for each of the three reproductive traits. On the basis of additive and maternal effects of A and SG expressed as deviations from PH, the only genetic component that significantly affected reproductive performance was the detrimental additive effect of SG in G2 and G3 for each of the three reproductive traits. Also, there was a consistent negative relationship between breed additive and maternal components for each of the three reproductive traits during each generation. Only 4 to 7% of the variation in reproductive performance was accounted for in the analyses that included breed additive, breed maternal, heterosis and average maternal heterosis effects.

Endocrine patterns in the postpartum beef cow associated with weaning: a comparison of the short and subsequent normal cycles.,"Ramirez-Godinez JA, Kiracofe GH, Schalles RR, Niswender GD.","Levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), progesterone and estradiol-17 beta were measured in five Polled Hereford cows. Blood samples were collected once or twice daily for 5 d, then every 6 h from 1 d before weaning (d 28 to 38 postpartum) until 10 d after the second postweaning estrus. Blood samples were again collected at daily intervals until the third postweaning estrus. All cows exhibited estrus within 4 d after weaning, a second estrus 8 to 10 d after the first and a third estrus 16 to 23 d after the second. All cows had peaks in serum concentrations of LH during the first (22.6 to 81.7 ng/ml) and second (4.4 to 149.0 ng/ml) postweaning estrus. Mean levels of LH in serum during the peak and the area under the LH curve during the first and second postweaning estrus did not differ. Serum levels of LH and FSH during the first 4 d of the short cycle did not differ from LH and FSH levels the first 4 d of the subsequent normal cycle. Levels of LH in serum for 4 d before the first LH surge, associated with the first postweaning estrus, did not differ from levels of LH found 4 d before the second Lh surge, associated with the second postweaning estrus. However, serum levels of FSH during the 4 d before the first ovulatory LH surge were lower (P = .05) than those observed during the 4-d period before the second ovulatory surge of LH. Progesterone levels were similar the first 6 d after the first and second estrous periods, but were lower after d 6 of the first (short) cycle than after d 6 of the second (normal) cycle. Estradiol peaks of 1.2 to 2.8 pg/ml were detected during the first postweaning estrus and 1.4 to 12.5 pg/ml during the second postweaning estrus, but due to the variability among cows mean levels of estradiol during first estrus did not differ from second estrus. These data agree with previous reports that postpartum anestrous cows had short cycles if they exhibit estrus in response to weaning. The early decline of progesterone after the first estrus apparently did not stem from lack of LH in serum, but the lower levels of FSH observed before this first ovulation may have been an important factor contributing to the reduced life span of the subsequent corpus luteum.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6811540,1982,J Anim Sci,1.711,74

Effect of growth rate through 30 months on reproductive performance of beef heifers.,"Fleck AT, Schalles RR, Kiracofe GH.","The effect of growth rate from birth through 30 months of age on the reproductive performance of Polled Hereford heifers calving as 2-year-olds was examined. Heifers with high gains during the first winter as weanlings had higher breeding efficiency when bred as year-lingins, had larger pelvic areas as 2-year-olds, gave birth to larger calves, had less calving difficulty at first parturition and had higher breeding efficiency at the subsequent breeding. Calf growth to weaning was positiviely related to first winter (weaning to yearling) gain of the dam. Heifers with high second winter gain had less calving difficulty at first parturition, slightly higher milk production and slightly higher breeding efficiency when rebred. Second winter gain of the dam had a high negative relationship with calf growth to weaning. Adequate growth from weaning to yearling was important for future production and reproduction through second breeding as 2-year-olds.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7193199,1980,J Anim Sci,1.711,35
A segmented line regression procedure to describe growth in beef cows.,"Warren JH, Schalles RR, Milliken G.","Three segmented linear regression lines were fitted simultaneously to regress weight of Polled Hereford female cattle on age. Resulting parameter estimates from the procedure measure size and rates of gain. Sire and year of birth had the greatest effects on growth traits before growth rate slowed when heifers were approximately 17 months of age but had less effect in later life. Genetic correlations between weights at all ages were positive, as were genetic correlations between degrees of maturity at all ages. Animals taking longer to reach mature weights had greater mature weights. Degree of maturity and weight were positively correlated at a given age, but changed to negative as the age interval between weight and degree of maturity increased. Animals more mature at any age grew slower until they reached full maturity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7429284,1980,Growth,Not Found,5
"Testicular hypoplasia in a Hereford bull with 61,XXY karyotype: the bovine counterpart of human Klinefelter's syndrome.","Dunn HO, Lein DH, McEntee K.","A Polled Hereford bull with good libido displayed gross testicular hypoplasia and azoospermia. His left testis weighed 23.6 g, approximately 10% of the testis weight of normal Herefords. Histopathologic examination of the left testis revealed small seminiferous tubules in advanced degeneration and very few with Sertoli cells. The number of Leydig cells was disproportionately large in relation to the seminiferous tubules. From both leucocyte and tissue cultures, the karyotypes were 61, XXY. This bull represents the bovine counterpart of human Klinefelter's syndrome.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7408494,1980,Cornell Vet,Not Found,21
Impotence in the bull: (1) Abnormal venous drainage of the corpus cavernosum penis.,"Ashdown RR, David JS, Gibbs C.","Six young bulls (two Friesian, two Charolais, one polled Devon and one North Devon) that had never served successfully, showed good libido but lacked penile erection. In five of these bulls, the short flaccid organ was not protruded during attempted service. Radiography of the cavernous bodies and veins of the penis in the living animal demonstrated major venous drainage of the corpus cavernosum penis (ccp) by the dorsal venous system in all cases. This was not seen in normal bulls. Radiography and anatomical preparations of post mortem specimens showed that the ccp was drained by the dorsal venous system throughout the length of the organ. Proximally, the cavernous spaces of the ccp anastomosed with those of the corpus spongiosum penis (csp) and were drained by numerous small veins. Distally, a system of larger veins, not seen in normal bulls, drained into left and right sides of the dorsal venous system. No microscopical abnormalities of spermatozoa or of testes were found, but there was a marked lack of spermatozoa in the caudae epididymides. The evidence suggests that abnormal venous drainage of the ccp may have been the immediate cause of impotence in these bulls.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/573016,1979,Vet Rec,2.05,25
Hereditary neuraxial edema in Polled Hereford calves.,"Cho DY, Leipold HW.","Two newborn Polled Hereford calves with hereditary neuraxial edema were available for clinical and pathological examination. The affected animals showed extensor spasms and were unable to rise. Pathologic lesions were microscopic and consisted of widespread vacuolation of the neuraxis, chiefly in white matter and less markedly in grey matter. The lesions were most severe in the brain stem and cerebellar white matter. Examination of the breeding record indicated sire-daughters matings and thus a probably autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/724564,1978,Pathol Res Pract,1.466,2
